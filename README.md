|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Humans are vertebrates        | We have a vertebral column or backbone called the spine.                                                |
| Skeletal system composition   | The human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments & tendons.                            |
| Body weight                   | The skeletal system accounts for about 20% of the body weight.                                         |
| Function                      | Bones provide the rigid skeleton that constitutes the body’s internal framework needed to stand.         |
| Number of bones               | The adult human skeleton usually consists of 206 bones.                                                 |
| Classification of bones       | Four types: long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.                                   |
| Protection                    | The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body. For example: the skull protects the brain, eyes, and nose. |

## Respiratory System

### Vital Facts

| Detail                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Breathing is vital and automatic.                                                                             |
| Each day you breathe about 20,000 times.                                                                      |
| By age 70, you will have taken at least 600 million breaths.                                                  |
| The respiratory system works with the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen and remove waste like CO₂.       |

### Organs

| Organs & Structures           | Function/Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lungs                         | Exchange gases (O₂ & CO₂) during breathing.                                  |
| Passageways                   | For airflow, blood vessels, and muscles.                                      |

### Respiratory Passages

| Tract               | Structures Included                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper respiratory   | Nose, pharynx, larynx (throat/voice box)                                             |
| Lower respiratory   | Trachea (windpipe), bronchial tree, lungs                                            |

### Respiration Function

- Respiration is the sequence of events that results in the delivery of oxygen into the body and the removal of CO₂.
- This gas exchange occurs in the tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli.
- Oxygen moves from air into blood; carbon dioxide moves from blood to air and is expelled.

### Cardiovascular System

| Component      | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| **Heart**      | - Powerful muscular pump; circulates blood.<br>- Weighs less than a pound; about the size of an adult fist.<br>- Located left of the chest, between the lungs and beneath the sternum.<br>- Four chambers: two atria (upper), two ventricles (lower). |
| **Heart Rate** | - Faster beats increase oxygen transport.<br>- Heart sounds are valves closing.<br>- Average rate: 72 beats per minute. |
| **Blood Vessels** | - Two main types: arteries (carry blood away from heart), veins (return blood to heart). |
| **Arteries**   | - The aorta (largest artery) branches into smaller arteries and capillaries, reaching every organ. |
| **Circulation**| - Oxygenated blood enters the left side of the heart, is pumped through the aorta, delivered via arteries and capillaries, and returns through veins. |

## Digestive System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System components          | Digestive tract + accessory organs (salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas).        |
| Functions                  | Ingestion, digestion, absorption, elimination.                                             |
| Tract                      | Long conveyor belt: food enters mouth, waste leaves anus.                                  |

### Accessory Organs

| Organ            | Function                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Salivary glands  | Moisten/lubricate food, begin carbohydrate breakdown.                                 |
| Liver            | Metabolizes nutrients, produces bile, detoxifies.                                     |
| Gallbladder      | Stores bile, helps digest and absorb fats.                                            |
| Pancreas         | Secretes enzymes and hormones (like insulin) for digestion and nutrient utilization.  |

**Gallbladder Removal Tip:**  
People who have their gallbladder removed cannot store bile; the liver still produces bile and sends it straight to the small intestine for fat digestion.

## Urinary System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Also called                | Renal system                                                                                |
| Main function              | Balances body fluids: stimulates thirst, produces, stores, and eliminates urine.            |
| Kidneys                    | Two bean-shaped organs, about fist-sized, in abdominal cavity on either side of spine.      |
| Ureters                    | Connect kidneys to urinary bladder.                                                         |
| Bladder                    | Temporary holding reservoir for urine.                                                      |
| Urethra                    | Expels urine from body (1–2 inches long in females, about 8 inches in males).               |

**Function:**  
Kidneys filter out waste (urea, uric acid) from the bloodstream and remove it as urine. They reabsorb fluids/other substances to prevent loss of water or essential salts. Only the bladder stores urine.

**Protecting Kidneys Tip:**  
Because kidneys are close to the body surface and protected only by fat, football players wear pads that stick out the top of their pants to protect their kidneys.

## Lesson Summary

- The respiratory system consists of the lungs, airflow passages, blood vessels, and muscles that bring in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.
- The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and blood vessels. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, veins carry deoxygenated blood back. It transports nutrients and oxygen to body cells.
- The digestive system is composed of the digestive tract and its accessory organs. Its four functions are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination.
- The urinary system balances body fluids by producing, storing, and eliminating urine. The kidneys filter out waste, reabsorb water and other substances, and produce urine.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | The immune system (lymphatic system) is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs defending against invaders.  |
| Function                | Produces, stores, and carries white blood cells (leukocytes) around the body to find and destroy foreign invaders.   |
| Antigens                | Unique substances on invaders (bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi) trigger immune response.                         |
| Inflammatory Response   | Symptoms: swelling, pain, redness, elevated temperature (e.g., stuffy nose, sore throat, fever from flu).            |
| Antibodies              | Some immune cells produce antibodies that bind to antigens, leading to their destruction.                            |

### Immune System Steps

1. White blood cells search for foreign invaders.
2. Antigen on foreign invader recognized.
3. Inflammatory response activated.
4. Immune cell produces antibody.
5. Antibodies bind to antigens.
6. Destruction of foreign body.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Skin, hair, nails, glands  | Make up the integumentary system. "Integumentary" = covering.                                          |
| Skin                       | Weighs 8–10 lbs, covers about 22 sq ft in adults.                                                      |

### Skin Functions

1. Protection from the environment (prevents loss of water/salts/heat, protects against bacteria).
2. Enclosure (covers and protects nerve fibers that send sensory messages).
3. Lubrication (contains glands producing sebum and sweat; sebum protects, sweat cools).
4. Body temperature regulation (special tissues maintain temperature).

### Hair and Nails

- Hair covers scalp/body for insulation.
- Nails (made of keratin) protect fingertips/toes from injury.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | Information signaling system, similar to nervous system, but uses chemical messages (hormones) instead of electrical ones.  |
| Function                | Maintains homeostasis by sensing hormone levels in blood and releasing appropriate hormones to restore balance.               |
| Major glands            | Pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, testes.                                        |
| System traits           | Glands are scattered throughout the body but considered one system due to similar function and mechanisms.                    |

# Module 3

## Physical Activity & Fitness

### Importance of Physical Activity:
- Key for people of all ages to improve overall health.
- Supports normal growth and development.
- Enhances mood, energy, and sleep quality.
- Reduces risk of chronic diseases.

---

### Beyond Basic Exercise:
Not just walking, running, or weightlifting.  
Includes activities for:
- Muscle strength
- Cardiorespiratory endurance
- Muscle endurance
- Flexibility
- Healthy body fat composition

---

### Outcome of Module:
- Understand the 5 components of physical fitness.
- Learn physical activity guidelines.
- Apply principles daily to improve health.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Describe each component of fitness, including the benefits and example activities.

> Only 1 in 3 children are physically active every day.  
> Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day.  
> More than 80% of adults do not meet the physical fitness guidelines.  

Do these statistics apply to you or your family?  
You already know that exercise is good for you. What you may not know is exactly what qualifies as exercise. In this lesson, you will learn about the five components of physical activity:  
**cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition.**

---

## Physical Fitness: What and Why
The definition of physical fitness is to perform daily tasks without injury or fatigue.  
Physical fitness is not the same as exercise. Exercise is a form of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive, performed with the goal of improving health or fitness.  

In other words:
> All exercise is physical activity, but not all physical activity is exercise.

---

## Five Components of Fitness
As previously mentioned, physical fitness is more than just exercise.  
This lesson will review the description, benefits, and activity examples of the five components of fitness:

1. Cardiorespiratory fitness
2. Muscular strength
3. Muscular endurance
4. Flexibility
5. Body composition

---

## Additional Fitness Components
**Tip:**  
In addition to the general five components of fitness, exercise and sports professionals may refer to other components of fitness that relate to specific sports performance.  

These are called skill-related components and include:  
- Power  
- Speed  
- Agility  
- Balance  
- Coordination

---

## Cardiorespiratory Fitness
The first component that most people associate with being physically fit is cardiorespiratory fitness.  
Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to perform large-muscle, whole-body exercise at moderate to vigorous intensities for extended periods of time.  

Cardiovascular fitness may also be referred to as **aerobic activities** because it requires the heart to supply the body with oxygen.  
The difference between this component and the others is that these activities can be sustained over a long time and improve the fitness of the heart and lungs.

---

### Benefits of Cardiovascular Fitness
Cardiovascular fitness helps the heart and lungs and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.  
The benefits of cardiovascular fitness, in conjunction with a healthy diet, include:
- Weight control and a reduced risk of obesity
- Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers
- Reduced blood pressure
- Improved mood, self-esteem, sleep, and blood cholesterol levels

---

### Types of Activities
The following activities help you achieve cardiovascular fitness:
1. Walking briskly
2. Running or jogging
3. Dancing
4. Swimming
5. Biking
6. Climbing stairs at work
7. Playing sports such as tennis, basketball, soccer, or racquetball
8. Using an elliptical trainer or a stair-stepping machine

---

## Muscular Strength
If you have ever been to a gym or fitness center, you have probably seen people lifting weights or using strength-building machines.  
They are improving a component of fitness called **muscular strength.**

Muscular strength is the amount of force a muscle group can produce. It is usually measured by the maximum amount of force produced in a single effort.  
In other words, it is how much weight you can lift, push, or pull one time.

---

### Benefits of Muscular Strength
You do not have to be an athlete or a bodybuilder to benefit from muscular strengthening activities.  
Incorporating any type of resistance activity into an exercise plan can:
- Improve muscle strength, posture, and ease of movement
- Improve the ability to perform everyday activities
- Strengthen tendons, ligaments, and bones
- Decrease the risk of falls and injury

---

### Examples of Activities
Strengthening exercises work a single muscle or small group of muscles as they move against resistance.  
This resistance can come from a number of sources:
1. Workout machines  
2. Free weights or barbells  
3. Elastic (resistance) bands  
4. Stairs, hills, and inclines  
5. Objects of higher weight (e.g., water, groceries)  
6. Bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats)  

---

### Bodyweight Exercises
**Tip:**  
Activities that require you to push or pull your body against gravity (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats without weights) require muscle strength.  

The muscles in your arms and back push against the force of gravity to move your body, hence the reason these are called **bodyweight exercises.**

[Not mentioned but remember weighted calisthenics!]

---

## Muscular Endurance
As you learned in the previous section, muscle strength is the ability to exert a maximal amount of force for a short period of time.  
However, there are activities, such as skiing and walking uphill, that require specific muscle groups to work for longer periods of time.  
These activities fall into the category of **muscular endurance.**

---

### Benefits of Muscular Endurance
The benefits of muscular endurance are similar to those of cardiorespiratory fitness and include:
1. Improving heart health  
2. Aiding in weight loss  
3. Improving mood and sleep quality  
4. Preventing age-related decline  
5. Increasing life span  

---

### Muscular Endurance Activities
Muscular endurance activities are sustained over a period of time.  
The following list of activities is a combination of cardiorespiratory activities and muscular strength activities:
1. Sustained walking, jogging, and running  
2. Cycling and swimming  
3. Resistance training with bands (lower weight and more repetitions)  
4. Circuit training  
5. Aerobics, kickboxing, and dance  
6. Rope climbing  
7. HIIT (high-intensity interval training)

---

### Muscular Endurance versus Cardiovascular Endurance
**Tip:**  
Muscular endurance activities benefit a muscle or small group of muscles.  
Cardiorespiratory fitness activities benefit the heart and lungs.

---

## Flexibility
Flexibility is one component of physical fitness that is often ignored.  
Most people think that flexibility only involves the muscles.  

In actuality, however, flexibility refers to the movement of the joints.  
The definition of flexibility is the ability of the joints to move through their full range of motion.

Flexibility is an important part of physical fitness because it:
- Allows the muscles to work at their full potential
- Reduces the risk of injury and pain
- Improves posture and balance

---

### Examples of Activities
Flexibility activities can be performed before or after an exercise session or can be a standalone activity.  
Examples include:
1. Stretching (static, dynamic, isostatic)  
2. Yoga  
3. Tai Chi  
4. Pilates  

---

## Body Composition
Body composition is a special term used in physical fitness that involves measuring the percentage of fat, muscle, water, and bone found in the human body.  

Body composition is expressed as the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass.  

**Formula:**  
`Total body weight = lean body mass (water, bone, muscle, and organs) + fat mass`

---

### Methods to Determine Body Composition
- Bioelectrical impedance (found in some bathroom scales)  
- Skinfold thickness measurements (with calipers)  
- Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)  
- Underwater weighing  

---

### Benefits of a Good Body Composition
Excess fat increases the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  
The benefits of maintaining a healthy amount of body fat include:
1. Decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease  
2. Increased functional ability (i.e., being able to move and exercise more freely)  
3. A better calorie-burning metabolism throughout the day  
4. A lean and toned body  

---

### Instructions
Match the name of the physical fitness component to its matching description.  

<img width="486" height="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f3776a-e295-47bf-851a-f50ddbdab721" />


1. Flexibility is the range of motion of a joint. Flexibility improves posture and balance, reduces injuries, and decreases pain during movement.  
2. Muscular endurance is the ability of a group of muscles or a specific muscle to work for a period of time. Examples include sustained walking, cycling, and resistance training.  
3. Muscular strength is the amount of force produced by the muscles. It is often measured by how much weight you can lift, push, or pull.  
4. Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to perform large-muscle, whole-body exercises at moderate to vigorous intensities for extended periods of time.  
5. A lower body fat composition reduces the risk of chronic diseases.  

---

## Lesson Summary
You should be able to clearly explain each component of physical fitness, along with its benefits and example activities.

Physical fitness is a state of overall health and well-being, characterized by the ability to effectively perform sports, occupational tasks, and daily activities.  
Engaging in regular physical activity and exercise supports weight management and significantly reduces the risk of various chronic diseases.

The five core components of physical fitness include:
- **Cardiorespiratory fitness** – Enhances heart and lung efficiency for sustained activity.  
- **Muscular strength** – Improves the ability to exert force.  
- **Muscular endurance** – Increases the capacity to perform repeated movements over time.  
- **Flexibility** – Promotes joint mobility and reduces the risk of injury.  
- **Body fat composition** – Supports a healthy balance between fat and lean mass for optimal function.

# The FITT Principles

There are four elements used to develop exercise plans to improve fitness levels in each of the five components of physical fitness. Use the acronym FITT to remember these elements:

- **Frequency** is the number of days that you engage in physical activity.
- **Intensity** is the amount of workload (resistance) of the activity (how hard you exercise).
- **Time** is the duration of the activity measured in seconds, minutes, and hours. It may also be specified as the number of sets and repetitions.
- **Type** describes the type of activity in which you engage, such as swimming, walking, resistance training, or stretching. Exercise plans should incorporate a variety of activities that include all five physical fitness components.

### Example Weekly Exercise Plan Using FITT Principles

| FITT Element | Cardiorespiratory Fitness (Aerobic Exercises)                         | Muscular Strength and Muscular Endurance                | Flexibility                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency** | 3–5 days per week                                                     | 2–3 days per week with 48 hours rest between sessions   | Most if not all days per week                      |
| **Intensity** | Keep heart rate in the target zone: 50–70% HRMax (moderate) or 70–85% (vigorous) | Sustain sufficient resistance to fatigue muscles; last repetitions should be difficult | Sustain resistance to the point of slight discomfort |
| **Time**     | Work at least 10 minutes at a time, for a total of 2.5 hours/week moderate or 1.25 hours/week vigorous | For general fitness, perform 3–5 sets of 5–7 repetitions | Complete 2–4 repetitions of each stretch and hold for 15–30 seconds; 10–12 repetitions for dynamic stretches |
| **Type**     | Continuous rhythmic activities (e.g., running, walking, swimming, cycling) | Strength training exercises targeting all major muscle groups | Stretching exercises targeting all major muscle groups |

<h1>Intensity Matters</h1>

<h5>intensity</h5>
<p>Frequency, time and type of activity are all self-explnatory. However, intensity needs a more in depth review. One way of moniotiring physical activity. intensity is to determeine wheather and indivual's pulse or heart rate is within the target zone during physical activity. This measurement is called target hear rate (THR) and can be measures using a digitial device or with your fingers and a clock. When you starting an exercise program, caculating a target heart rate zone (THR zone) is very benefical to ensure that you are exercisign safely and effectively.</p>

<h5>Moderate  versus Vigorus and intensity</h5>
<p>> For moderate-intesity physical activity, a person's target heart rate should be 50%-70% of his or her maximum heart rate. For vigorus-intensity physical activity, a person's target heart rate should be 70-85% of their maximum heart rate</p>

<h5>Calculating THR and THR Zone</h5>
<p>To caculate the heart rate zone by determining the maximum heart rate (MHR). An estimate of a person's maximum age-related heart rate can be obtained by subtracting the person's age from 220. (220 - age = MHR). Computer the precentage MHR for the low and high values. For examples, the MHR for a 30-year old is 190 bpm. To obtain teh moderate intesity 50%- 70% heart rate zone, multiply (190 x 0.50 = 95 bpm) for the low value and (190 x 0x70 = 133 bpm) for the high value </p>

| AGE | MAXIMUM   | 50%              | 70%               | 85%               |
|-----|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 30  | 190 bpm   | 190 x 0.50 = 95 bpm  | 190 x 0.70 = 133 bpm | 190 x 0.85 = 162 bpm |
| 40  | 180 bpm   | 180 x 0.50 = 90 bpm  | 180 x 0.70 = 126 bpm | 180 x 0.85 = 153 bpm |
| 50  | 170 bpm   | 170 x 0.50 = 85 bpm  | 170 x 0.70 = 119 bpm | 170 x 0.85 = 145 bpm |
| 60  | 160 bpm   | 160 x 0.50 = 80 bpm  | 160 x 0.70 = 112 bpm | 160 x 0.85 = 136 bpm |

> <h3>Bad breath</h3>

>TIP:
> <p>Everyone has bad breath (halitosis) at some point in their life. Many of the tips for keeping your mouth healthy are the same as the tips for stopping bad breath, such as brushing and flossing. To prevent bad breath, it is also important to decrease your consumption of sugary foods and drinks and have your teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist at least twice a year.</p>
><h1>have your teeth cleaned by a dental hygienist at least twice a year</h1>

<h1>Special Recommendations for Adolescents</h1>

<h3>Daily Bathing</h3>
<p>Sweating is a natural function that helps cool the body. Sweat production increases with the onset of puberty. It is recommended to take a daily shower, ensuring that all body parts are washed, and use deodorants or antiperspirants.</p>

<h3>Acne Treatment</h3>
<p>Many teens experience acne during their teenage years due to changing hormones and an increase in certain bacteria. Acne occurs when pores get clogged with bacteria and dead skin cells. Acne treatments include washing the face twice daily with a mild cleanser, using over-the-counter acne medications, using doctor-prescribed medications, avoiding oil-based makeups, and limiting the consumption of fried foods.</p>

<h3>Hair Care</h3>
<p>Good nutrition, physical activity, sun protection, and other healthy habits can help your hair be healthy. Take caution when using blow dryers and curling irons, as they can damage the hair. If your hair is oily, it should be washed on a daily basis with an oil-free shampoo. Those with dry hair should wash less frequently and use a conditioning rinse after shampooing.</p>

<h1>Lesson Summary</h1>

<p>Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to identify personal hygiene recommendations for children, adolescents, and adults. Take a moment to think about what you have learned in this lesson:</p>

<h2>Lesson Summary</h2>

<p>Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to identify personal hygiene recommendations for children, adolescents, and adults.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know the hygiene recommendations for:
    <ul>
      <li>Bathing</li>
      <li>Using the toilet</li>
      <li>Handwashing</li>
      <li>Taking care of the nails, hair, ears, eyes, and mouth</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Special recommendations for adolescents include:

      <li>Washing oily hair daily; washing dry hair less frequently while also using a conditioning rinse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
> Identify methods to prevent and respond to unintentional injuries.

<p>Injuries and violence affect everyone, regardless of age, race, or economic status. In the first half of life, more Americans die from violence and injuries—such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, or homicides—than from any other cause, including cancer, HIV, or the flu. This makes injury the leading cause of death among persons aged 1–44.1 In this lesson, you will learn how to prevent unintentional injuries from drowning, poisoning, fires, and falls and how to respond should an injury occur.</p>

<h2>Drowning</h2>
<p>Each day, about 10 people in the U.S. die from unintentional (accidental) drowning. The highest drowning rates are among children one to four years of age. Drowning is the fifth leading cause of unintentional injury death for people of all ages. </p>

<h3>Key Prevention Tips</h3>
<p>According to the CDC, the four most important actions that can help prevent drowning include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 Learn life-saving skills. Everyone should know the basics of swimming (i.e., floating, moving through the water) and how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</li><li>2 Fence it off. Install a four-sided isolation fence, with self-closing and self-latching gates, around backyard swimming pools. </li>
  
  <li>3 Make life jackets a must. Make sure children wear life jackets in and around natural bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean, even if they know how to swim. Adults who are weaker swimmers or in a watercraft should also use life jackets. </li>
  
  <li>Be on the lookout. When kids are in or near water (including bathtubs), closely supervise them at all times. Because drowning happens quickly and quietly, adults watching kids in or near water should avoid distracting activities like playing cards, reading books, talking on the phone, and using alcohol or drugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Poison</h3>
<p>Every 14 seconds, someone calls a poison control center. A child ingesting any more than a taste of hand sanitizer could be at risk for alcohol poisoning. This year, poison control centers have managed 5,700 cases related to laundry detergent packet exposure in children five and younger. A poison is any substance, including medications, that is harmful to the body if too much is eaten, inhaled, injected, or absorbed through the skin.  </p>

<h3>Sources of Poisons</h3>
<p>It’s not just chemicals in your home marked with clear warning labels that can be dangerous to children. Everyday items in your home, such as household cleaners and medicines, can be poisonous to children as well. Medication dosing mistakes and unsupervised ingestion are common ways that children are poisoned. Active, curious children will often investigate—and sometimes try to eat or drink—anything that they can get into.</p>

<h3>Key Prevention Tips</h3>
> Use these tips to poison-proof your home and school to protect children.

<ul>
  <li>Lock poisons up and away. Keep medicines and toxic products, such as cleaning solutions and detergent pods, in their original packaging where children can't see or get them.</li>
  
  <li>Know the number. Put the nationwide poison control center phone number on or near every telephone, and program it into your cell phone. Call the poison control center if you think a child has been poisoned but is awake and alert. Call 911 if there is a poison emergency and the child has collapsed or is not breathing.</li>
  
  <li>Read the label. Follow label directions carefully and read all warnings when giving medicines to children.</li>
  
  <li>Don't keep it if you don't need it. Safely dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. To dispose of medicines, turn them in at a local take-back program or during National Drug Take-Back events. If you cannot find a program, mix them with coffee grounds or kitty litter and throw them away.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Fires and Burns</h3>
<p>Fortunately, deaths due to fires have declined over the past few years, which is likely because of the increased use of smoke alarms as well as education programs about what to do if you are in a fire. However, over 300 children ages 0 to 19 are treated in emergency rooms every day for burn-related injuries, and two children die as a result of being burned.</p>

<h3>Key Prevention Tips</h3>
> The CDC provides the following steps to prevent burns from fires and scalding.

<ul>
  
  <li>Be "alarmed." Install and maintain smoke alarms in your home on every floor and near all rooms that family members sleep in. Test your smoke alarms once a month to make sure they are working properly. Use long-life batteries when possible.</li>
  
  <li>Have an escape plan. Create and practice a family fire escape plan, and involve children in the planning. Make sure everyone knows at least two ways out of every room. Identify a central meeting place outside.</li>
  
  <li>Cook with care. Use safe cooking practices. For example, never leave food unattended on the stove. Additionally, supervise or restrict children's use of stoves, ovens, and especially microwaves.</li>
  
  <li>Check the water heater temperature. Set your water heater's thermostat to 120 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. Infants and small children may not be able to get away from water that may be too hot. Maintaining a constant thermostat setting can help control the water temperature throughout your home, preventing it from getting too high. Test the water at the tap if possible.</li>
  
</ul>

> <h3>Younger versus Older Children</h3>

>TIP:
> <p>Younger children are more likely to sustain injuries from scald burns that are caused by hot liquids or steam. Older children are more likely to sustain injuries from flame burns that are caused by direct contact with fire.</p>

<h3>Falls</h3>
<p>Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injuries for all children ages 0 to 19. Every day, approximately 8,000 children are treated in U.S. emergency rooms for fall-related injuries. This adds up to almost 2.8 million children each year.</p>

<h3>Key Prevention Tips</h3>
<p>The CDC provides the following tips to protect children from unintentional falls and injuries on the playground.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Play safely. Falls on the playground are a common cause of injury. Check to make sure that the surfaces under playground equipment are safe and soft and consist of appropriate materials (such as wood chips or sand, not dirt or grass). The surface materials should be well-maintained and appropriately deep.</li>
  
  <li>Make your home safer. Use home safety devices, such as guards on windows that are above ground level, stair gates, and guard rails. These devices can help keep a busy, active child from falling.5</li>
  
</ul>

<h1>Biking and Skateboarding</h1>

<h3>Biking Safety</h3>

<p>Bicycle falls account for only 1% of all falls in the United States. However, bicyclists face a higher risk of crash-related injuries and deaths than occupants in motor vehicles.</p>

<h3>Key Prevention Tips for Biking</h3>
<p>In 2015, in the United States, over 1,000 bicyclists died, and there were almost 467,000 bicycle-related injuries. These bicycle-related injuries and deaths can be prevented.</p>

<h3>Bicycle Helmets and Helmet Laws</h3>
<p>Bicycle helmets reduce the risk of head and brain injuries in the event of a crash. All bicyclists, regardless of age, can help protect themselves by wearing properly fitted bicycle helmets every time they ride. When purchasing a helmet, make sure it is approved by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Following bicycle helmet laws and increasing helmet use reduces the number of crash-related injuries and deaths among children and adults.</p>

<h3>Active Lighting and Rider Visibility</h3>

> Use the following tips to increase visibility when cycling.

<ul>
  
  <li>Fluorescent clothing can make bicyclists visible from further away than regular clothing during the daytime.</li>
  
  <li>Retro-reflective clothing can make bicyclists more visible at night.</li>
  
  <li>Active lighting can include front white lights, rear red lights, or other lighting on the bicycle or bicyclist. This lighting may improve the visibility of bicyclists</li>
  
</ul>


<h3>Skateboarding Safety</h3>
<p>Before using the skateboard, ensure it is checked for safety. Wear a helmet, knee and elbow pads, and wrist guards. Non-slippery shoes are also a good idea so that you can have better control of your board.</p>


<h3>Skateboarding Helmets</h3>
<p>It's important to use helmets that are approved by one of the groups that test helmets. The Snell B-95 standard is best for skateboarding helmets</p>

<h1>Responding to an Injury</h1>
<p>Accidents happen, and some are more serious than others. Calling 911 should be reserved for life-threatening emergencies. In these cases, if help cannot arrive in time, you may be able to save someone's life. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), for example, is used to help people whose hearts or breathing have stopped. The choking maneuver is used on people who have choked on something.</p>

<h3>Responding to Minor Injuries</h3>
<p>You can also learn to handle common injuries and wounds. Cuts and scrapes, for example, should be rinsed with cool water. To stop bleeding, apply firm but gentle pressure using gauze. If blood soaks through, add more gauze, keeping the first layer in place. Continue to apply pressure.</p>

<h3>First Aid Kit</h3>
<p>It is important to have a first aid kit available. Keep one at home and one in your car. It should include a first-aid guide. Since each first aid kit has different types of items, read the guide in the first aid kit to learn how to use the items in case an emergency happens</p>

<h3>CPR</h3>
> When someone's blood flow or breathing stops, seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can transpire quickly.

<h3>Hands-only CPR</h3>
<p>If an adult or adolescent suddenly collapses and is still breathing, you can do "hands-only" CPR, even if you have not had training. "Hands-only" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives.</p>

<h3>Conventional CPR</h3>
<p>The American Heart Association recommends conventional CPR (that is, CPR with a combination of breaths and compressions) for all infants and children, for adult victims who are found already unconscious and not breathing normally, and for any victims of drowning or collapse due to breathing problems (American Heart Association, 2019).</p>

<h1>Module 5</h1>
> <h1>BOOKMARK(pg)[29]</h1>

<h1>Learning Objectives<</h1>
> identify the sleep stages and cycles.

<p> Sleep is an important part of your daily routine you spend about one third of your time doing it. Quality sleep and getting enough of it at the right times is an essential to surival as food and water. Without sleep you can't form or maintain the pathwas in your brain that let you learn and create new memories. it's also harder to concentrate and respond quickly in this lesson, you will learn about the two methods your body uses to control the amount of time you are asleep and awake and what happens to your brain and body while you sleep </p>

<h3>sleep wake cycles </h3>
<p>if you've ever traveled to a different time zone and felt "jet-lagged," you can blame it on your internal clock. That's right your body is a virtual 24 hour clock that controls when you are awake and when your body is ready for sleep. Most people notice that they naturally experience diffrenet levels of sleepiness and alertness throughout the day, but the what causes these patterns? there are two internal biological mechanism homeostasis and circadian ryhtem that work tegoether to regulate when you are awake and sleep </p>

<h3>Homeostasis</h3>
<p>Homeostasis literally means "stable body." It is the automatic process the body uses to remain internally stable while adjusting to conditions. For example, if you don't drink fluids throughout the day, you would start to feel thirsty, which is your body's mechanism to trigger you to drink. How does homeostasis work with the sleep-wake cycle? Sleep-wake homeostasis keeps track of the body's need for sleep. The homeostatic sleep drive reminds the body to sleep after a certain time and regulates sleep intensity. This sleep drive gets stronger every hour you are awake and causes you to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.</p>

<h3>Circadian Rhythms</h3>
<p>Your body has several internal clocks, called circadian clocks. These typically follow a 24-hour repeating rhythm called the circadian rhythm. Your central circadian clock, located in your brain, tells you when it is time for sleep. Other circadian clocks are located in organs throughout your body. Your body's internal clocks are in sync with certain cues in the environment. For example, light signals received through your eyes tell a special area in your brain that it is daytime. This area of your brain helps align your body clock with periods of the day and night. Light, darkness, and other cues help determine when you feel awake and when you feel drowsy. The rhythm diminishes and shifts due to aging, which impacts the sleep-wake cycle.</p>

> <h3>Sleep Cycles Change with Age</h3>

> TIP:
<p>The rhythm and timing of the body clock change with age. Teens fall asleep later at night than younger children and adults. One reason for this is because melatonin is released and peaks later in the 24-hour cycle for teens. As a result, it's natural for many teens to prefer later bedtimes and to sleep later in the morning than adults.</p>

<h1>Stages of Sleep</h1>
<p>Sleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of four different stages that are differentiated by brainwave activity. During a typical night, the brain cycles through all the stages several times while sleeping. </p>

<h3>REM versus Non-REM Sleep</h3>
<p>The stages of sleep can be divided into two general phases: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. In contrast, there is no rapid eye movement during NREM sleep, which occurs in the first three stages of sleep. The body cycles through all stages of non-REM and REM sleep several times during a typical night. Increasingly longer, deeper REM periods occur toward morning.</p>

<h1>Stages of Sleep</h1>

# Stages of One Sleep Cycle

The hypnogram chart shows a person's passage through one cycle of the stages of sleep.  

- **Y-axis**: Stages in the sleep-wake cycle (from lowest to highest: Stage 3, Stage 2, Stage 1, REM, Wakefulness)  
- **X-axis**: Time in minutes  

The cycle moves from **wakefulness → stage 1 → stage 2 → stage 3 → REM sleep → wakefulness**.  
- **Stages 1–3**: Non-REM sleep, occurring during the first **65 minutes** of sleep.  
- **REM sleep**: Occurs after non-REM for **10–15 minutes** before the brain moves back to a wakeful state, and the cycle repeats.

---

## Stage 1: Non-REM Sleep
- Transition between wakefulness and sleep.  
- Lasts several minutes.  
- Light sleep where the body fluctuates between sleep and wakefulness.

---

## Stage 2: Non-REM Sleep
- You are now asleep.  
- Prepares the body for deeper sleep.  
- Heartbeat and breathing slow down.  
- Muscles relax further.  

 **Tip**: A person spends more of the repeated sleep cycles in **stage 2** sleep than in any other stage.

---

## Stage 3: Non-REM Sleep
- Known as **deep sleep** or **slow-wave sleep**.  
- Essential for feeling refreshed in the morning.  

 **Tip**: Stage 3 occurs in **longer periods** during the **first half of the night**.

---

## REM Sleep Stage
- First occurs about **75–90 minutes** after falling asleep.  
- Eyes move rapidly behind closed eyelids.  
- Breathing becomes faster and irregular.  
- Heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels.  

 **Tip**:  
  - Most dreaming happens during REM sleep (some dreams can also occur in non-REM).  
  - Arm and leg muscles are temporarily paralyzed to prevent acting out dreams.  
  - REM sleep typically occurs later in the night.  
  - People experience less REM sleep in **colder temperatures**.

# Terminology

It is important to know the terminology related to the human sleep cycle.

## Definitions and Terms

| Definition                                                                                 | Term               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| The automatic process that maintains the body's internal stability                        | Sleep-wake homeostasis |
| Short period between wakefulness and sleep                                                | Stage 1 sleep      |
| Deep, non-REM sleep that occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night      | Stage 3 sleep      |
| Internal 24-hour cycle that helps the body regulate activities, like sleep               | Circadian rhythm   |
| Period of light sleep as the body prepares for deeper sleep                               | Stage 2 sleep      |
| Period when most dreaming occurs                                                          | REM sleep          |

---

## Explanations

- **Sleep-wake homeostasis**: Homeostasis is automatic and keeps the body's internal activity stable.  
- **Stage 1 sleep**: The stage in which the body is drifting from being awake to being asleep.  
- **Stage 3 sleep**: Non-REM, but the most refreshing stage of sleep for humans. It is also called deep sleep and occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night.  
- **Circadian rhythm**: Keeps the body's internal "clocks" in sync with the repeating pattern of day and night.  
- **Stage 2 sleep**: Occurs between very light sleep in stage 1 and the deeper sleep of stage 3.  
- **REM sleep**: When most of the dreaming occurs. The muscles become temporarily paralyzed at this time.

---

## Lesson Summary

Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to identify the sleep stages and cycles. Key points:

- Two internal biological mechanisms work together to regulate when you are awake and sleep:  
  - **Homeostasis**  
  - **Circadian rhythm**
- During sleep, you cycle between **non-REM** and **REM** sleep.
- There are **three stages of non-REM sleep**:
  1. **Stage 1**: Transition between wakefulness and sleep.  
  2. **Stage 2**: Reached when you are asleep.  
  3. **Stage 3**: Deep sleep or slow-wave sleep. The body needs this stage to feel refreshed in the morning.  
- Most dreaming occurs during **REM sleep**, which first occurs about **75–90 minutes after falling asleep** and happens more frequently as the night progresses.

<h1>Sleep Recommendations</h1>

<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, age affects the number of hours of sleep people need as well as people's sleeping patterns. Sleep duration and pattern also vary among individuals. However, based on research, the following chart provides a recommended range of hours for sleep duration to achieve good health (National Sleep Foundation, 2019).</p>

<img width="679" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53135452-5b6c-4353-8070-574aedba79c6" />

>

> TIP:
><p>In general, people get less sleep than they need due to longer work hours and the increasing availability of entertainment and other activities. Many people feel they can "catch up" on missed sleep during the weekend. However, depending on how sleep-deprived a person is, sleeping longer on the weekends may not be adequate.</p>

<h1>Impact of Sleep Deprivation</h1>
<p>Sleep deficiency is a common public health problem in the United States. People in all age groups report that they do not get enough sleep. The following data was gathered according to a CDC health survey</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>About 7–19% of adults in the United States do not get enough rest or sleep every day.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Nearly 40% of adults report falling asleep during the day without meaning to at least once a month.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Approximately 50–70 million Americans have chronic (ongoing) sleep disorders.</p></li>

</ul>

<h1>Sleep Deprivation and Chronic Health Problems</h1>
<p>A common myth is that people can learn to function on little sleep with no negative effects. However, research shows that getting enough quality sleep at the right times is vital for mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. Sleep deficiency is linked to many chronic health problems, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h3>heart disease,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>kidney disease,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>high blood pressure,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>diabetes,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>diabetes,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>obesity,</h3></li>
  
  <li><h3>depression.</h3></li>
  
</ul>

> <h1>REM Sleep and Mental Cognition</h1>

> TIP:
> <p>Memory consolidation most likely requires both non-REM and REM sleep. As a person ages, they spend less time in REM sleep, which may cause mild cognitive impairment.</p>

<h1>Sleep Deprivation and Risks</h1>

 <p>Sleep deficiency is associated with an increased risk of injury in adults, teens, and children and leads to a general slowing of response speed. For example, driver sleepiness (not related to alcohol) is responsible for serious car crash injuries and deaths. In the elderly, sleep deficiency might be linked to an increased risk of falls, broken bones, and cognitive impairment disorders. In addition, sleep deficiency has played a role in human errors linked to tragic accidents, such as nuclear reactor meltdowns, the grounding of large ships, and aviation accidents</p>

> <h1>Children and Adolescents</h1>

> TIP:
> <p>Sleep (and the lack thereof) impacts critical thinking abilities. Studies suggest that sleeping shortly after learning new information helps people retain and recall that information later. Children and adolescents who do not get enough sleep are more likely to have attention and behavioral problems, which can contribute to poor academic performance in school.</p>

# Strategies to Sleep Better

Getting enough sleep is good for your health. Use the following tips to improve your sleep:

1. **Set a schedule**  
   Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day.

2. **Exercise daily**  
   Exercise 20–30 minutes a day, but avoid exercising a few hours before going to sleep.

3. **Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol**  
   Do not consume caffeine or nicotine late in the day, and avoid alcoholic drinks before sleeping.

4. **Limit digital device use**  
   Avoid using tablets, smartphones, computers, or televisions 30 minutes before going to sleep.

5. **Relax before bedtime**  
   Try reading, taking a warm bath, or engaging in another calming activity.

6. **Create a sleep-friendly environment**  
   Avoid bright lights and loud sounds, keep the room at a comfortable temperature, and do not watch TV or keep a computer in your bedroom.

7. **Do not lie awake in bed**  
   If you can’t fall asleep, do something else—like reading—until you feel tired.

8. **Consult a doctor if needed**  
   If you have trouble sleeping or feel unusually tired during the day, see a doctor. Most sleep disorders can be treated effectively.

> <h1>UNIT 2</h1>
> <h2>BOOKMARK(pg[36])</h2>

Just as a car requires gas or electricity to run, people need "fuel" in the form of food to power their bodies. The foods people eat provide them with a range of small and large nutrients.  

- **Micronutrients**: Nutrients that are required in small quantities.  
- **Macronutrients**: Nutrients that are required in large quantities.  

(*"Micro"* means small, and *"macro"* means big.)  

After engaging in this module, you should be able to:  
- Identify the functions of macronutrients and micronutrients.  
- Recognize the sources of macronutrients and micronutrients.  

# Learning Objectives

- Identify sources of macronutrients and their role in body functions.

---

## What Are Macronutrients?

You have probably heard of **carbohydrates, proteins, and fats**, but did you know that they are considered macronutrients?  
The human body requires large quantities of these nutrients because they are the only ones that provide the **energy** your body needs to grow, repair, insulate, and develop new tissues.  

Foods are often made of a mixture of macronutrients:  
- Example: Blueberry muffins have carbohydrates and fats.  
- Example: Milk has carbohydrates, protein, and fat.  

**Why is this important?**  
Knowing the functions and sources of macronutrients in your foods will help you select healthy food choices and track your food intake.

## Craving Carbohydrates? Learn Why

### The Primary Function of Carbohydrates: Energy
If you crave carbohydrates, it may be a sign that your body needs more energy. Only carbohydrates can provide a **quick source of energy** for your cells, tissues, and organs.  

- **Energy yield:** 4 calories per gram  

---

### What Are the Sources of Carbohydrates?

In general, **carbohydrates come from plants**. They can be divided into **complex** and **simple** carbohydrates.

---

#### Complex Carbohydrates
Provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.  
**Sources:**
- Breads and cereals  
- Pasta  
- Starchy vegetables (e.g., potatoes, cassava)  
- Legumes (e.g., beans)  
- Rice  
- Corn  

---

#### Simple Carbohydrates
Include sugars that occur naturally in foods or are added during processing.

| **Naturally Occurring Sugars** | **Added Sugars*** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Fruits and 100% fruit juice   | Table sugar (white, brown, cane) |
| Vegetables                    | Syrups (corn, maple, agave) |
| Milk and dairy products       | High-fructose corn syrup (sodas, drinks) |
| Honey, 100% maple syrup       | Baked goods (muffins, cookies) |

\*Added sugars are either added during food processing or packaged as sugar.

---

### Dietary Fiber
Fiber is a type of carbohydrate but cannot be digested and provides no calories.  
**Types of Fiber:**
- **Soluble:** Dissolves in water  
- **Insoluble:** Does not dissolve in water  

**Sources:**
- Whole grains and cereals  
- Whole fruit  
- Vegetables  
- Nuts and seeds  
- Beans and legumes  

**Tip: Sweet vs. Complex Carbohydrates**  
- **Simple carbohydrates** taste sweet (short chains).  
- **Complex carbohydrates** taste starchy (long chains).

---

## The Power of Protein

### Important Functions of Protein
Protein is found in every cell of the body. Your body needs protein to:  
- Build and maintain bones, muscles, cartilage, blood, and skin.  
- Provide energy (4 calories per gram).  

Your body does **not store protein**, so you must eat enough daily.  

---

### Sources of Protein
Proteins come from both **animal** and **plant-based** sources.

| **Animal Sources (Complete)** | **Plant-Based Sources*** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Fish                          | Soy (soy milk, tofu, tempeh, edamame) |
| Eggs                          | Lentils, beans, legumes |
| Dairy products (milk, yogurt) | Nuts and nut butters |
| Red meat (beef, bison, deer)  | Quinoa, kamut, teff |
| Poultry (chicken, turkey)     |                          |
| Pork, lamb, goat              |                          |

\*Plant proteins are usually incomplete except for soy and quinoa.

## Facts About Dietary Fats

### Five Important Functions of Fats
1. Provide energy (9 calories per gram)  
2. Help absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)  
3. Support hormone production and nerve function  
4. Provide essential fats (e.g., omega-3)  
5. Make food more flavorful and help you feel full  

---

### Types of Fats
- **Unsaturated Fats:** Healthy fats, usually liquid (oils).  
- **Saturated Fats:** Solid at room temperature, raise cholesterol.  
- **Trans Fats:** Created during processing, harmful to heart health.  

---

### Sources of Fats
| **Type**        | **Sources** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Unsaturated Fats | Vegetable oils (olive, canola, corn, safflower), mayonnaise, avocados, fatty fish, nuts, seeds |
| Saturated Fats   | Whole milk products, butter, animal fats, coconut oil, palm oil |
| Trans Fats      | Margarine, non-dairy creamers, processed baked goods, deep-fried foods |

# Learning Objectives

    Identify sources of common micronutrients and their role in body functions.

In the previous lesson, you learned about the macronutrients that provide the calories you need to live. But your body needs more than calories to survive and be healthy. It needs small amounts of vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) that help you use the calories. In this lesson, you will learn about the functions and sources of common vitamins and minerals that your body needs to work properly.

## What are Vitamins?
### Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K
Vitamins © 2019 WGU

Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. 

There are 13 vitamins your body needs. They include the following:

- Vitamin A
- B vitamins  
  - Thiamine (B-1)
  - Riboflavin (B-2)
  - Niacin (B-3)
  - Pantothenic acid (B-5)
  - Biotin
  - Vitamin B-6
  - Cobalamin (B-12)
  - Folate
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin E
- Vitamin K

---

### B-Complex
**Tip:**  
The B vitamins are commonly known as B-complex because they work together. There are eight vitamins in the B-complex. B vitamins are more commonly known by their names than by their numbers.

---

## Vitamins: Water- versus Fat-Soluble
Vitamins are classified as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The difference between the two groups is very important as it determines how each vitamin acts within the body.  

- A water-soluble vitamin can dissolve in water. It is carried through the body to the body tissues but cannot be stored in the body. Therefore, it is important you get enough of them in your food each day.  
- Fat-soluble vitamins do not dissolve in water. They need fat in order to be absorbed. They are stored in the liver and in other fatty tissues for future use. Excessive amounts can be toxic.

### Fat-Soluble vs Water-Soluble Vitamins
| FAT-SOLUBLE | WATER-SOLUBLE |
|-------------|---------------|
| vitamin A   | B-vitamin complex |
| vitamin D   | vitamin C |
| vitamin E   | |
| vitamin K   | |

---

## Vitamin Basics: Functions and Sources
Vitamins play a major role in keeping your body healthy. When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created. Review the following table of essential vitamin functions and good sources in the diet.

| VITAMIN NAME | IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS | GOOD FOOD SOURCES | WATER- OR FAT-SOLUBLE |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Vitamin A | Vision health; protects the body tissue from damage | **Plants:** colorful sources<br>**Animals:** whole-milk dairy products, liver | Fat-soluble |
| B Vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folate) | Helps the body obtain or make energy from the food eaten; essential for brain function; vitamin B-12 needed for the formation of red blood cells | **Animal:** variety<br>**Plants:** leafy green vegetables, beans, cereal | Water-soluble |
| Vitamin C | Important for skin, bones, and connective tissue; promotes healing; helps the body absorb iron for blood; helps the body absorb calcium and is essential for bone development; plays a role in the nervous, muscular, and immune systems | **Plants:** fruits and vegetables (e.g., citrus, peppers, tomatoes, greens, juices) | Water-soluble |
| Vitamin D | Helps the body absorb calcium and is essential for bone development; plays a role in the nervous, muscular, and immune systems | **Animals:** milk, egg yolks, liver, oily fish (including salmon and mackerel)<br>**Plants:** enriched cereal<br>(Note: The body makes it naturally with exposure to sunlight.) | Fat-soluble |
| Vitamin E | Protects the body tissue from damage; keeps immune system strong; supports the formation of blood cells | **Plants:** vegetable oils and margarine, nuts, seeds, leafy greens | Fat-soluble |
| Vitamin K | Helps the body make proteins for healthy bones, tissues, and blood clotting | **Animals:** limited source in meat and eggs<br>**Plants:** mostly green vegetables, dark berries | Fat-soluble |

---

### Supplementation
**Tip:**  
The best way to get enough vitamins is to eat a balanced diet with a variety of foods. You can usually get all your vitamins from the foods you eat. If you are on a restricted diet, however, you may need to take vitamin supplements. It's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider first.

### Question

Which vitamin helps with vision and is found in red, orange, and yellow vegetables, as well as dark-green leafy vegetables?

- Vitamin D
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin E
- Vitamin C

 Vitamin A is found in both plants and animals. The vitamin A in plant sources is called carotenoids. Animal sources include liver, dairy products, and fatty meats.

### Question

Which three nutrients are part of the B-vitamin complex? 

- Thiamine
- Folate
- Niacin
- Retinol

 There are eight B vitamins that are referred to as B-complex vitamins. They include thiamine (B-1), riboflavin (B-2), niacin (B-3), pantothenic acid (B-5), biotin, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folate. The B vitamins help your body get or make energy from the food you eat. Animal proteins, leafy green vegetables, beans, and cereal are sources of B vitamins.

### Question

Which vitamin is only available from eating animal protein? 

- Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine)
- Vitamin B-12
- Vitamin K
- Niacin

 Vitamin B-12 (cobalamine) is only found in animal products—poultry, meat, fish, and dairy products. Vegans and vegetarians may be more prone to a vitamin B-12 deficiency unless they supplement their diet with vitamin B-12 or nutritional yeast.

Which food is the best source of vitamin C?

Orange juice

Spinach

Strawberry

Bell pepper

 Although all the choices are sources of vitamin C, one cup of chopped raw red bell pepper has twice the amount of vitamin C as a cup of orange juice, 10 times more than strawberries, and four times more than spinach. 

### Question

Which vitamin can be produced by your body with exposure to sunlight?

- Vitamin D
- Vitamin K
- Vitamin C
- Folate

 Your body naturally makes vitamin D with exposure to sunlight, but it is also found in milk and dairy products, egg yolks, salt water fish such as salmon, and liver. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, is needed for bone development because it helps your body absorb calcium.

### Question

Which vitamin's primary function is to protect body tissue from damage caused by substances that can harm cells and tissues, and to keep the immune system strong against viruses and bacteria?

- Vitamin K
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin E
- Vitamin A
Vitamin E, an antioxidant, plays an important role in protecting your body from harmful substances that break down body tissue and from viruses and bacteria. Good sources of vitamin E include vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens.

### Question

Which vitamin helps make proteins for healthy bones, tissues, and blood clotting?

- Vitamin D
- Vitamin E
- Vitamin K
- Vitamin A

 Vitamin K, along with Vitamin D and calcium, are necessary for bone development and maintenance. Vitamin K also plays an important role in blood clotting. In fact, newborns have very little vitamin K and usually get a shot of vitamin K soon after they are born.

### True or False

Fat-soluble vitamins are only found in fatty foods.

- True
- False

 Fat-soluble vitamins need fat to be absorbed by the gut but are not always found in foods with fat. For example, non-fat foods such as spinach, non-fat milk, and carrots are sources of the fat-soluble vitamin A.

# Mineral Basics: Functions and Sources

Nutrition facts label with minerals.

"Two Percent Milk Nutrition Facts Label" © 2019 Syndigo

Unlike vitamins, minerals are elements that are not broken down, and they are not created by plants and animals. Minerals are absorbed by plants and animals through the soil and food. When you eat, you consume the minerals that plants and animals absorbed.

This lesson will focus on the following four important minerals:

- calcium
- sodium
- potassium
- iron

---

## Why Are Minerals Important?

Minerals are important for your body to stay healthy. Your body uses minerals for many different jobs, including building bones, making hormones, and regulating your heartbeat. Many minerals work cooperatively with other minerals and vitamins to perform a bodily function. As you review the functions of minerals, try to identify the minerals and vitamins that have the same function.

| MINERAL NAME | MOST NOTABLE FUNCTIONS |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| Calcium | Blood vessel contraction; proper structure and function of bones and teeth; muscle contraction  
![blood icon](blood-icon) ![bones icon](bones-icon) ![muscles icon](muscles-icon) |
| Iron | Found in red blood cells; helps provide oxygen to the cells, tissues, and organs; assists in the creation of certain hormones  
![blood icon](blood-icon) ![metabolism icon](metabolism-icon) ![hormones icon](hormones-icon) |
| Sodium | Electrolyte that aids fluid balance and maintenance of blood pressure; needed for muscle function  
![water balance icon](water-balance-icon) ![muscles icon](muscles-icon) |
| Potassium | Electrolyte that maintains fluid status in cells; helps with nerve transmission; muscle function  
![water balance icon](water-balance-icon) ![nerves icon](nerves-icon) ![muscles icon](muscles-icon) |

---

### Electrolytes

**Tip:**  
Electrolytes are minerals that are "electric" because they carry an electric charge. Examples of electrolytes include sodium, potassium, and calcium.

---

## What Are the Sources of Minerals?

You need to eat a variety of plant-based foods and animal proteins to obtain the essential minerals to stay healthy. Review the following table with a list of foods that are sources of calcium, iron, sodium, and potassium.

| MINERAL | GOOD FOOD SOURCES |
|---------|-------------------|
| Calcium | - dairy products  
- leafy greens and green vegetables  
- fish with soft bones  
- calcium-enriched cereals  
- juices and soy and rice drinks  
- tofu |
| Iron | - animal protein (e.g., liver, mussels, clams, oysters, beef, chicken, pork)  
- enriched breakfast cereals, pasta, grains  
- beans and tofu  
- spinach, broccoli |
| Sodium | - table salt  
- packaged and processed foods (e.g., chips, cold cuts, frozen meals, pizza)  
- soy sauce and bottled dressings  
- soups |
| Potassium | - leafy greens  
- fruit from vines (e.g., grapes, blackberries)  
- vegetables (e.g., carrots, potatoes, tomatoes)  
- fruits (e.g., banana, orange, grapefruit)  
- milk and dairy products |


### Question

Jose is learning about the importance of a balanced diet for healthy muscles. In addition to vitamins D and K, which three micronutrients play a role in muscle function?

- Calcium
- Vitamin A
- Potassium
- Sodium

 The minerals calcium, potassium, and sodium help with muscle contraction and relaxation. Vitamin D and K help with the development and maintenance of bones.

### Question

Sanjay has been feeling lightheaded when standing up and much more tired than usual. After some tests, his nurse practitioner shares that Sanjay is anemic. His red blood cell count is low so he is not getting enough oxygen throughout his body. The nurse practitioner prescribes which micronutrient for Sanjay?

- Iron
- Vitamin A
- Sodium
- Potassium

Iron is found in red blood cells. It helps provide oxygen to the cells of our body. The oxygen helps the cells produce energy. A main cause of anemia is iron deficiency.

### Question

Nathan is teaching a class about nutrients that protect the body tissue from damage caused by substances that can harm cells, tissues, and organs. Which two micronutrients should he include in his lesson?

- Vitamin E
- Iron
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C

 Vitamins A and E may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Some nutrients that protect the body tissues from damage are called antioxidants.

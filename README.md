## Skeletal System Overview

| Concept                       | Detail                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Humans are vertebrates        | We have a vertebral column or backbone called the spine.                                                |
| Skeletal system composition   | The human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments & tendons.                            |
| Body weight                   | The skeletal system accounts for about 20% of the body weight.                                         |
| Function                      | Bones provide the rigid skeleton that constitutes the body’s internal framework needed to stand.         |
| Number of bones               | The adult human skeleton usually consists of 206 bones.                                                 |
| Classification of bones       | Four types: long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.                                   |
| Protection                    | The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body. For example: the skull protects the brain, eyes, and nose. |

## Respiratory System

### Vital Facts

| Detail                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Breathing is vital and automatic.                                                                             |
| Each day you breathe about 20,000 times.                                                                      |
| By age 70, you will have taken at least 600 million breaths.                                                  |
| The respiratory system works with the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen and remove waste like CO₂.       |

### Organs

| Organs & Structures           | Function/Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lungs                         | Exchange gases (O₂ & CO₂) during breathing.                                  |
| Passageways                   | For airflow, blood vessels, and muscles.                                      |

### Respiratory Passages

| Tract               | Structures Included                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper respiratory   | Nose, pharynx, larynx (throat/voice box)                                             |
| Lower respiratory   | Trachea (windpipe), bronchial tree, lungs                                            |

### Respiration Function

- Respiration is the sequence of events that results in the delivery of oxygen into the body and the removal of CO₂.
- This gas exchange occurs in the tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli.
- Oxygen moves from air into blood; carbon dioxide moves from blood to air and is expelled.

## Cardiovascular System

| Component             | Notes                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heart                 | Powerful muscular pump; responsible for circulating blood. Weighs less than a pound, about the size of an adult fist.   |
|                       | Located on the left side of the chest, between lungs and beneath the sternum.                                           |
|                       | Four chambers: two atria (upper), two ventricles (lower).                                                               |
| Heart Rate            | The faster the heart beats, the more oxygen it transports. Sounds are heart valves closing. Beats 72 times/min (avg).    |
| Blood Vessels         | Two categories: arteries (away from heart), veins (return to heart).                                                    |
| Arteries              | The aorta (largest artery) branches to smaller arteries and capillaries to every organ.                                 |
| Circulation           | Oxygenated blood enters left side of heart, pumped through aorta, delivered via arteries/capillaries, returns via veins.|

## Digestive System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System components          | Digestive tract + accessory organs (salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas).        |
| Functions                  | Ingestion, digestion, absorption, elimination.                                             |
| Tract                      | Long conveyor belt: food enters mouth, waste leaves anus.                                  |

### Accessory Organs

| Organ            | Function                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Salivary glands  | Moisten/lubricate food, begin carbohydrate breakdown.                                 |
| Liver            | Metabolizes nutrients, produces bile, detoxifies.                                     |
| Gallbladder      | Stores bile, helps digest and absorb fats.                                            |
| Pancreas         | Secretes enzymes and hormones (like insulin) for digestion and nutrient utilization.  |

**Gallbladder Removal Tip:**  
People who have their gallbladder removed cannot store bile; the liver still produces bile and sends it straight to the small intestine for fat digestion.

## Urinary System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Also called                | Renal system                                                                                |
| Main function              | Balances body fluids: stimulates thirst, produces, stores, and eliminates urine.            |
| Kidneys                    | Two bean-shaped organs, about fist-sized, in abdominal cavity on either side of spine.      |
| Ureters                    | Connect kidneys to urinary bladder.                                                         |
| Bladder                    | Temporary holding reservoir for urine.                                                      |
| Urethra                    | Expels urine from body (1–2 inches long in females, about 8 inches in males).               |

**Function:**  
Kidneys filter out waste (urea, uric acid) from the bloodstream and remove it as urine. They reabsorb fluids/other substances to prevent loss of water or essential salts. Only the bladder stores urine.

**Protecting Kidneys Tip:**  
Because kidneys are close to the body surface and protected only by fat, football players wear pads that stick out the top of their pants to protect their kidneys.

## Lesson Summary

- The respiratory system consists of the lungs, airflow passages, blood vessels, and muscles that bring in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.
- The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and blood vessels. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, veins carry deoxygenated blood back. It transports nutrients and oxygen to body cells.
- The digestive system is composed of the digestive tract and its accessory organs. Its four functions are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination.
- The urinary system balances body fluids by producing, storing, and eliminating urine. The kidneys filter out waste, reabsorb water and other substances, and produce urine.

## Immune System

| Aspect                  | Description                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | The immune system (lymphatic system) is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs defending against invaders.  |
| Function                | Produces, stores, and carries white blood cells (leukocytes) around the body to find and destroy foreign invaders.   |
| Antigens                | Unique substances on invaders (bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi) trigger immune response.                         |
| Inflammatory Response   | Symptoms: swelling, pain, redness, elevated temperature (e.g., stuffy nose, sore throat, fever from flu).            |
| Antibodies              | Some immune cells produce antibodies that bind to antigens, leading to their destruction.                            |

### Immune System Steps

1. White blood cells search for foreign invaders.
2. Antigen on foreign invader recognized.
3. Inflammatory response activated.
4. Immune cell produces antibody.
5. Antibodies bind to antigens.
6. Destruction of foreign body.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Skin, hair, nails, glands  | Make up the integumentary system. "Integumentary" = covering.                                          |
| Skin                       | Weighs 8–10 lbs, covers about 22 sq ft in adults.                                                      |

### Skin Functions

1. Protection from the environment (prevents loss of water/salts/heat, protects against bacteria).
2. Enclosure (covers and protects nerve fibers that send sensory messages).
3. Lubrication (contains glands producing sebum and sweat; sebum protects, sweat cools).
4. Body temperature regulation (special tissues maintain temperature).

### Hair and Nails

- Hair covers scalp/body for insulation.
- Nails (made of keratin) protect fingertips/toes from injury.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | Information signaling system, similar to nervous system, but uses chemical messages (hormones) instead of electrical ones.  |
| Function                | Maintains homeostasis by sensing hormone levels in blood and releasing appropriate hormones to restore balance.               |
| Major glands            | Pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, testes.                                        |
| System traits           | Glands are scattered throughout the body but considered one system due to similar function and mechanisms.                    |

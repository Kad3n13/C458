|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Humans are vertebrates        | We have a vertebral column or backbone called the spine.                                                |
| Skeletal system composition   | The human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments & tendons.                            |
| Body weight                   | The skeletal system accounts for about 20% of the body weight.                                         |
| Function                      | Bones provide the rigid skeleton that constitutes the body’s internal framework needed to stand.         |
| Number of bones               | The adult human skeleton usually consists of 206 bones.                                                 |
| Classification of bones       | Four types: long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones.                                   |
| Protection                    | The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body. For example: the skull protects the brain, eyes, and nose. |

## Respiratory System

### Vital Facts

| Detail                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Breathing is vital and automatic.                                                                             |
| Each day you breathe about 20,000 times.                                                                      |
| By age 70, you will have taken at least 600 million breaths.                                                  |
| The respiratory system works with the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen and remove waste like CO₂.       |

### Organs

| Organs & Structures           | Function/Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lungs                         | Exchange gases (O₂ & CO₂) during breathing.                                  |
| Passageways                   | For airflow, blood vessels, and muscles.                                      |

### Respiratory Passages

| Tract               | Structures Included                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upper respiratory   | Nose, pharynx, larynx (throat/voice box)                                             |
| Lower respiratory   | Trachea (windpipe), bronchial tree, lungs                                            |

### Respiration Function

- Respiration is the sequence of events that results in the delivery of oxygen into the body and the removal of CO₂.
- This gas exchange occurs in the tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli.
- Oxygen moves from air into blood; carbon dioxide moves from blood to air and is expelled.

### Cardiovascular System

| Component      | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| **Heart**      | - Powerful muscular pump; circulates blood.<br>- Weighs less than a pound; about the size of an adult fist.<br>- Located left of the chest, between the lungs and beneath the sternum.<br>- Four chambers: two atria (upper), two ventricles (lower). |
| **Heart Rate** | - Faster beats increase oxygen transport.<br>- Heart sounds are valves closing.<br>- Average rate: 72 beats per minute. |
| **Blood Vessels** | - Two main types: arteries (carry blood away from heart), veins (return blood to heart). |
| **Arteries**   | - The aorta (largest artery) branches into smaller arteries and capillaries, reaching every organ. |
| **Circulation**| - Oxygenated blood enters the left side of the heart, is pumped through the aorta, delivered via arteries and capillaries, and returns through veins. |

## Digestive System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System components          | Digestive tract + accessory organs (salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas).        |
| Functions                  | Ingestion, digestion, absorption, elimination.                                             |
| Tract                      | Long conveyor belt: food enters mouth, waste leaves anus.                                  |

### Accessory Organs

| Organ            | Function                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Salivary glands  | Moisten/lubricate food, begin carbohydrate breakdown.                                 |
| Liver            | Metabolizes nutrients, produces bile, detoxifies.                                     |
| Gallbladder      | Stores bile, helps digest and absorb fats.                                            |
| Pancreas         | Secretes enzymes and hormones (like insulin) for digestion and nutrient utilization.  |

**Gallbladder Removal Tip:**  
People who have their gallbladder removed cannot store bile; the liver still produces bile and sends it straight to the small intestine for fat digestion.

## Urinary System

| Aspect                     | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Also called                | Renal system                                                                                |
| Main function              | Balances body fluids: stimulates thirst, produces, stores, and eliminates urine.            |
| Kidneys                    | Two bean-shaped organs, about fist-sized, in abdominal cavity on either side of spine.      |
| Ureters                    | Connect kidneys to urinary bladder.                                                         |
| Bladder                    | Temporary holding reservoir for urine.                                                      |
| Urethra                    | Expels urine from body (1–2 inches long in females, about 8 inches in males).               |

**Function:**  
Kidneys filter out waste (urea, uric acid) from the bloodstream and remove it as urine. They reabsorb fluids/other substances to prevent loss of water or essential salts. Only the bladder stores urine.

**Protecting Kidneys Tip:**  
Because kidneys are close to the body surface and protected only by fat, football players wear pads that stick out the top of their pants to protect their kidneys.

## Lesson Summary

- The respiratory system consists of the lungs, airflow passages, blood vessels, and muscles that bring in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.
- The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and blood vessels. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, veins carry deoxygenated blood back. It transports nutrients and oxygen to body cells.
- The digestive system is composed of the digestive tract and its accessory organs. Its four functions are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination.
- The urinary system balances body fluids by producing, storing, and eliminating urine. The kidneys filter out waste, reabsorb water and other substances, and produce urine.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | The immune system (lymphatic system) is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs defending against invaders.  |
| Function                | Produces, stores, and carries white blood cells (leukocytes) around the body to find and destroy foreign invaders.   |
| Antigens                | Unique substances on invaders (bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi) trigger immune response.                         |
| Inflammatory Response   | Symptoms: swelling, pain, redness, elevated temperature (e.g., stuffy nose, sore throat, fever from flu).            |
| Antibodies              | Some immune cells produce antibodies that bind to antigens, leading to their destruction.                            |

### Immune System Steps

1. White blood cells search for foreign invaders.
2. Antigen on foreign invader recognized.
3. Inflammatory response activated.
4. Immune cell produces antibody.
5. Antibodies bind to antigens.
6. Destruction of foreign body.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Skin, hair, nails, glands  | Make up the integumentary system. "Integumentary" = covering.                                          |
| Skin                       | Weighs 8–10 lbs, covers about 22 sq ft in adults.                                                      |

### Skin Functions

1. Protection from the environment (prevents loss of water/salts/heat, protects against bacteria).
2. Enclosure (covers and protects nerve fibers that send sensory messages).
3. Lubrication (contains glands producing sebum and sweat; sebum protects, sweat cools).
4. Body temperature regulation (special tissues maintain temperature).

### Hair and Nails

- Hair covers scalp/body for insulation.
- Nails (made of keratin) protect fingertips/toes from injury.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overview                | Information signaling system, similar to nervous system, but uses chemical messages (hormones) instead of electrical ones.  |
| Function                | Maintains homeostasis by sensing hormone levels in blood and releasing appropriate hormones to restore balance.               |
| Major glands            | Pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, testes.                                        |
| System traits           | Glands are scattered throughout the body but considered one system due to similar function and mechanisms.                    |

# Module 3

## Physical Activity & Fitness

### Importance of Physical Activity:
- Key for people of all ages to improve overall health.
- Supports normal growth and development.
- Enhances mood, energy, and sleep quality.
- Reduces risk of chronic diseases.

---

### Beyond Basic Exercise:
Not just walking, running, or weightlifting.  
Includes activities for:
- Muscle strength
- Cardiorespiratory endurance
- Muscle endurance
- Flexibility
- Healthy body fat composition

---

### Outcome of Module:
- Understand the 5 components of physical fitness.
- Learn physical activity guidelines.
- Apply principles daily to improve health.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Describe each component of fitness, including the benefits and example activities.

> Only 1 in 3 children are physically active every day.  
> Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day.  
> More than 80% of adults do not meet the physical fitness guidelines.  

Do these statistics apply to you or your family?  
You already know that exercise is good for you. What you may not know is exactly what qualifies as exercise. In this lesson, you will learn about the five components of physical activity:  
**cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition.**

---

## Physical Fitness: What and Why
The definition of physical fitness is to perform daily tasks without injury or fatigue.  
Physical fitness is not the same as exercise. Exercise is a form of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive, performed with the goal of improving health or fitness.  

In other words:
> All exercise is physical activity, but not all physical activity is exercise.

---

## Five Components of Fitness
As previously mentioned, physical fitness is more than just exercise.  
This lesson will review the description, benefits, and activity examples of the five components of fitness:

1. Cardiorespiratory fitness
2. Muscular strength
3. Muscular endurance
4. Flexibility
5. Body composition

---

## Additional Fitness Components
**Tip:**  
In addition to the general five components of fitness, exercise and sports professionals may refer to other components of fitness that relate to specific sports performance.  

These are called skill-related components and include:  
- Power  
- Speed  
- Agility  
- Balance  
- Coordination

---

## Cardiorespiratory Fitness
The first component that most people associate with being physically fit is cardiorespiratory fitness.  
Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to perform large-muscle, whole-body exercise at moderate to vigorous intensities for extended periods of time.  

Cardiovascular fitness may also be referred to as **aerobic activities** because it requires the heart to supply the body with oxygen.  
The difference between this component and the others is that these activities can be sustained over a long time and improve the fitness of the heart and lungs.

---

### Benefits of Cardiovascular Fitness
Cardiovascular fitness helps the heart and lungs and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.  
The benefits of cardiovascular fitness, in conjunction with a healthy diet, include:
- Weight control and a reduced risk of obesity
- Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers
- Reduced blood pressure
- Improved mood, self-esteem, sleep, and blood cholesterol levels

---

### Types of Activities
The following activities help you achieve cardiovascular fitness:
1. Walking briskly
2. Running or jogging
3. Dancing
4. Swimming
5. Biking
6. Climbing stairs at work
7. Playing sports such as tennis, basketball, soccer, or racquetball
8. Using an elliptical trainer or a stair-stepping machine

---

## Muscular Strength
If you have ever been to a gym or fitness center, you have probably seen people lifting weights or using strength-building machines.  
They are improving a component of fitness called **muscular strength.**

Muscular strength is the amount of force a muscle group can produce. It is usually measured by the maximum amount of force produced in a single effort.  
In other words, it is how much weight you can lift, push, or pull one time.

---

### Benefits of Muscular Strength
You do not have to be an athlete or a bodybuilder to benefit from muscular strengthening activities.  
Incorporating any type of resistance activity into an exercise plan can:
- Improve muscle strength, posture, and ease of movement
- Improve the ability to perform everyday activities
- Strengthen tendons, ligaments, and bones
- Decrease the risk of falls and injury

---

### Examples of Activities
Strengthening exercises work a single muscle or small group of muscles as they move against resistance.  
This resistance can come from a number of sources:
1. Workout machines  
2. Free weights or barbells  
3. Elastic (resistance) bands  
4. Stairs, hills, and inclines  
5. Objects of higher weight (e.g., water, groceries)  
6. Bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats)  

---

### Bodyweight Exercises
**Tip:**  
Activities that require you to push or pull your body against gravity (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats without weights) require muscle strength.  

The muscles in your arms and back push against the force of gravity to move your body, hence the reason these are called **bodyweight exercises.**

[Not mentioned but remember weighted calisthenics!]

---

## Muscular Endurance
As you learned in the previous section, muscle strength is the ability to exert a maximal amount of force for a short period of time.  
However, there are activities, such as skiing and walking uphill, that require specific muscle groups to work for longer periods of time.  
These activities fall into the category of **muscular endurance.**

---

### Benefits of Muscular Endurance
The benefits of muscular endurance are similar to those of cardiorespiratory fitness and include:
1. Improving heart health  
2. Aiding in weight loss  
3. Improving mood and sleep quality  
4. Preventing age-related decline  
5. Increasing life span  

---

### Muscular Endurance Activities
Muscular endurance activities are sustained over a period of time.  
The following list of activities is a combination of cardiorespiratory activities and muscular strength activities:
1. Sustained walking, jogging, and running  
2. Cycling and swimming  
3. Resistance training with bands (lower weight and more repetitions)  
4. Circuit training  
5. Aerobics, kickboxing, and dance  
6. Rope climbing  
7. HIIT (high-intensity interval training)

---

### Muscular Endurance versus Cardiovascular Endurance
**Tip:**  
Muscular endurance activities benefit a muscle or small group of muscles.  
Cardiorespiratory fitness activities benefit the heart and lungs.

---

## Flexibility
Flexibility is one component of physical fitness that is often ignored.  
Most people think that flexibility only involves the muscles.  

In actuality, however, flexibility refers to the movement of the joints.  
The definition of flexibility is the ability of the joints to move through their full range of motion.

Flexibility is an important part of physical fitness because it:
- Allows the muscles to work at their full potential
- Reduces the risk of injury and pain
- Improves posture and balance

---

### Examples of Activities
Flexibility activities can be performed before or after an exercise session or can be a standalone activity.  
Examples include:
1. Stretching (static, dynamic, isostatic)  
2. Yoga  
3. Tai Chi  
4. Pilates  

---

## Body Composition
Body composition is a special term used in physical fitness that involves measuring the percentage of fat, muscle, water, and bone found in the human body.  

Body composition is expressed as the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass.  

**Formula:**  
`Total body weight = lean body mass (water, bone, muscle, and organs) + fat mass`

---

### Methods to Determine Body Composition
- Bioelectrical impedance (found in some bathroom scales)  
- Skinfold thickness measurements (with calipers)  
- Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)  
- Underwater weighing  

---

### Benefits of a Good Body Composition
Excess fat increases the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  
The benefits of maintaining a healthy amount of body fat include:
1. Decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease  
2. Increased functional ability (i.e., being able to move and exercise more freely)  
3. A better calorie-burning metabolism throughout the day  
4. A lean and toned body  

---

### Instructions
Match the name of the physical fitness component to its matching description.  

<img width="486" height="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f3776a-e295-47bf-851a-f50ddbdab721" />


1. Flexibility is the range of motion of a joint. Flexibility improves posture and balance, reduces injuries, and decreases pain during movement.  
2. Muscular endurance is the ability of a group of muscles or a specific muscle to work for a period of time. Examples include sustained walking, cycling, and resistance training.  
3. Muscular strength is the amount of force produced by the muscles. It is often measured by how much weight you can lift, push, or pull.  
4. Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to perform large-muscle, whole-body exercises at moderate to vigorous intensities for extended periods of time.  
5. A lower body fat composition reduces the risk of chronic diseases.  

---

## Lesson Summary
You should be able to clearly explain each component of physical fitness, along with its benefits and example activities.

Physical fitness is a state of overall health and well-being, characterized by the ability to effectively perform sports, occupational tasks, and daily activities.  
Engaging in regular physical activity and exercise supports weight management and significantly reduces the risk of various chronic diseases.

The five core components of physical fitness include:
- **Cardiorespiratory fitness** – Enhances heart and lung efficiency for sustained activity.  
- **Muscular strength** – Improves the ability to exert force.  
- **Muscular endurance** – Increases the capacity to perform repeated movements over time.  
- **Flexibility** – Promotes joint mobility and reduces the risk of injury.  
- **Body fat composition** – Supports a healthy balance between fat and lean mass for optimal function.

# The FITT Principles

There are four elements used to develop exercise plans to improve fitness levels in each of the five components of physical fitness. Use the acronym FITT to remember these elements:

- **Frequency** is the number of days that you engage in physical activity.
- **Intensity** is the amount of workload (resistance) of the activity (how hard you exercise).
- **Time** is the duration of the activity measured in seconds, minutes, and hours. It may also be specified as the number of sets and repetitions.
- **Type** describes the type of activity in which you engage, such as swimming, walking, resistance training, or stretching. Exercise plans should incorporate a variety of activities that include all five physical fitness components.

### Example Weekly Exercise Plan Using FITT Principles

| FITT Element | Cardiorespiratory Fitness (Aerobic Exercises)                         | Muscular Strength and Muscular Endurance                | Flexibility                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency** | 3–5 days per week                                                     | 2–3 days per week with 48 hours rest between sessions   | Most if not all days per week                      |
| **Intensity** | Keep heart rate in the target zone: 50–70% HRMax (moderate) or 70–85% (vigorous) | Sustain sufficient resistance to fatigue muscles; last repetitions should be difficult | Sustain resistance to the point of slight discomfort |
| **Time**     | Work at least 10 minutes at a time, for a total of 2.5 hours/week moderate or 1.25 hours/week vigorous | For general fitness, perform 3–5 sets of 5–7 repetitions | Complete 2–4 repetitions of each stretch and hold for 15–30 seconds; 10–12 repetitions for dynamic stretches |
| **Type**     | Continuous rhythmic activities (e.g., running, walking, swimming, cycling) | Strength training exercises targeting all major muscle groups | Stretching exercises targeting all major muscle groups |

<h1>Intensity Matters</h1>

<h5>intensity</h5>
<p>Frequency, time and type of activity are all self-explnatory. However, intensity needs a more in depth review. One way of moniotiring physical activity. intensity is to determeine wheather and indivual's pulse or heart rate is within the target zone during physical activity. This measurement is called target hear rate (THR) and can be measures using a digitial device or with your fingers and a clock. When you starting an exercise program, caculating a target heart rate zone (THR zone) is very benefical to ensure that you are exercisign safely and effectively.</p>

<h5>Moderate  versus Vigorus and intensity</h5>
<p>> For moderate-intesity physical activity, a person's target heart rate should be 50%-70% of his or her maximum heart rate. For vigorus-intensity physical activity, a person's target heart rate should be 70-85% of their maximum heart rate</p>

<h5>Calculating THR and THR Zone</h5>
<p>To caculate the heart rate zone by determining the maximum heart rate (MHR). An estimate of a person's maximum age-related heart rate can be obtained by subtracting the person's age from 220. (220 - age = MHR). Computer the precentage MHR for the low and high values. For examples, the MHR for a 30-year old is 190 bpm. To obtain teh moderate intesity 50%- 70% heart rate zone, multiply (190 x 0.50 = 95 bpm) for the low value and (190 x 0x70 = 133 bpm) for the high value </p>

| AGE | MAXIMUM   | 50%              | 70%               | 85%               |
|-----|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 30  | 190 bpm   | 190 x 0.50 = 95 bpm  | 190 x 0.70 = 133 bpm | 190 x 0.85 = 162 bpm |
| 40  | 180 bpm   | 180 x 0.50 = 90 bpm  | 180 x 0.70 = 126 bpm | 180 x 0.85 = 153 bpm |
| 50  | 170 bpm   | 170 x 0.50 = 85 bpm  | 170 x 0.70 = 119 bpm | 170 x 0.85 = 145 bpm |
| 60  | 160 bpm   | 160 x 0.50 = 80 bpm  | 160 x 0.70 = 112 bpm | 160 x 0.85 = 136 bpm |

<h1>Physical Activity Guidelines: Children and Adolescents</h1>
<p>The U.S Department of Health and Human Services developed recommened physcial activity guidlines to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure. The guidelines are given on weekly basis and can be described using the FITT principles</p>

<h3>Key Guidelines for School-Aged Children and Adolescents </h3>

<p>it is important to provide young people oppourunityies and encouragement to paticipate in physcial activites that are appropriate for their age that are enjoyable and the offer variety</p>

<h1>Module 7</h1>

<p>Although 59% of Americans align their food choices with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, individuals in the United States spend $14 billion each year in obesity-related medical costs, $245 billion for type 2 diabetes, and $316 billion for heart disease, all of which may be prevented through a healthy diet. Why doesn't everyone eat healthy? It may be that 8 in 10 Americans think advice about what to eat is conflicting. It may also be due to cultural beliefs, lack of resources, or simply that many unhealthy foods taste good.</p>
<br>

  <p>In this module, you will use your knowledge of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to better understand the food choices that make up a healthy eating pattern. More specifically, you will explore the general U.S. Dietary Guidelines and key recommendations for healthy eating. You will learn about the tools available to monitor your eating patterns and teach others how to monitor theirs. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify components of a healthy diet.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h2>Identify the dietary guidelines and key recommendations for a healthy diet</h2>

<p>About 117 million individuals have one or more preventable chronic diseases. More than two-thirds of adults and nearly one-third of children and youth are overweight or obese. The good news is that these diseases can be preventable through healthy eating.</p>

<h3>In this lesson, you will learn about the dietary recommendations for a healthy diet.</h3>

<h1>General U.S Dietary Guidlines at a Glance</h1>

<p>What exactly is healthy eating? Every five years, U.S. Health and Human Services revises the U.S. Dietary Guidelines that provide recommendations for healthy eating to promote overall health and help prevent chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines consist of general guidelines and key recommendations to help prevent diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. There are five general guidelines that encourage eating healthy.</p>


<h1>Recommendation 1: Follow a Healthy Eating Pattern across the Life Span</h1>

<p>Develop a healthy eating pattern of consuming foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed. All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories. All forms of foods—including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen—can be included in healthy eating patterns.</p>

<h1>What dose a Healthy Eating Pattern include and Limit</h1>

> <h3>A healthy eating pattern includes the following:</h3>

> <h3> A variety of vegetables from all subgroups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dark green vegetables</li>
  <li>Red and orange vegetables</li>
  <li>Legumes (e.g beans, and peas)</li>
  <li>Starchy vegetables (e.g corn, potatoes)</li>
  
  > <h3>Others</h3>
  
  <li>Fruits, especially whole fruits</li>
  <li>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</li>
  <li>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages</li>
  <li>A variety of profein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy prodcuts</li>
  <li>Oils (e.g Canola, Olive)</li>
  
  > <h3>A healthy eating pattern limits the following:</h3>
  
  <li>Saturated fats</li>
  <li>Trans fats</li>
  <li>Added sugars</li>
  <li>Soduim</li>
</ul>

---

<h1>Recommendation 2: Focus on Variety, Nutrient Density, and Amount</h1>
<p>choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods from each food group in recommended amounts. Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins, minerals, and other substances with little or no solid fats and added sugars, refined starches, or sodium.</p>

<h3>Example of nutrient-dense food choices include the following:</h3>

| **CHOOSE THIS FOOD**                       | **INSTEAD OF THIS FOOD**                      | **RATIONALE**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh fruit (80–100 calories)             | 1 cup fruit juice drink (140 calories)<br>12 ounces sweetened sugar drinks (160 calories) | Whole fruit has fiber not found in fruit juice or sweetened beverages. Unlike whole fruit, sweetened sugar drinks do not have any vitamins or minerals.         |
| Skinless grilled chicken breast (31 calories per ounce) | Chicken nuggets (85 calories per ounce)        | Chicken nuggets have more calories, saturated fat, and sodium than grilled chicken.                                                                             |
| 1 cup kale and quinoa salad (190 calories)| 1 cup Caesar salad with romaine lettuce (180 calories) | The calories of these salads are almost the same, but the kale and quinoa have more nutrient value. Kale has vitamins A, C, and K and fiber. Quinoa is a complete protein rich in fiber, iron, zinc, B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. |

---

<h1>Recommendation 3: Limit Sugars and Saturated Fats and Reduce Sodium Intake</h1>

<p>Consume food low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within a healthy eating pattern. 

For example, added sugars are found in sodas, soft drinks, and processed baked goods. Saturated and trans fats are found in ice cream and fast food like hamburgers. Pizza and sliced processed meats for sandwiches have high levels of sodium. </p>

<h1>Recommendation 4: Shift to Healthier Food and Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>Replace typical food and beverage choices with more nutrient-dense options. Be sure to consider personal preferences to maintain shifts over time. 

For example, instead of fettuccine alfredo — a pasta dish with refined grains and high-fat dairy—choose pasta primavera made with whole-grain pasta, vegetables, and a small amount of olive oil.</p>

---

<h1>Recommendation 5: Support Healthy Eating Patterns in all Situations</h1>

<p>Everyone has a role in creating and supporting healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to community. As a teacher, you will have an important role supporting children and teaching them both how to make healthy food choices and what the impact is of nutrition on physical and emotional health.</p>

# Did I Get This - Question 1

| **Scenario** | **Dietary Guideline** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Jay and his wife have two children... They eat more low-fat meat, use oils, herbs, and whole fruits. | **Follow a healthy eating pattern across the life span** | Correct! Jay and his family are choosing healthy foods for proper growth, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting added sugar and sodium. |
| Ellen eats fruits, vegetables, low-fat protein daily, and controls portion sizes to avoid weight gain. | **Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount** | Correct! Ellen focuses on nutrient-dense foods and portion sizes to maintain her body weight. |

| Helga teaches her students about Dietary Guidelines and healthy choices. | **Support healthy eating patterns in all situations** | Correct! Helga is promoting healthy eating patterns through education and guidance. |

<h1>Best Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>When you think about your overall food intake, it is easy to forget that the beverages you drink are part of your diet. In fact, they account for almost 20% of total calorie intake. When it comes to beverages, the largest source of calories is sweetened beverages, accounting for 35% of calories. For these reasons and others, the recent Dietary Guidelines included beverages as part of the eating pattern.</p>

<p>Beverages vary in their nutrient and calorie content. Some, like water, do not contain any calories. Others, like soft drinks, contain calories but little nutritional value. Finally, drinks like milk and fruit and vegetable juices contain important nutrients such as calcium, potassium, and vitamin D in addition to calories.</p>

<p>Beverages make a substantial contribution to total water needs and to nutrient and calorie intakes in most typical eating patterns. In fact, other major sources of calories from beverages are milk and milk drinks, alcoholic beverages, fruit and vegetable juices, and coffee and tea. </p>

<h1>What Should You Drink?</h1>

<p>Beverages that are calorie-free (especially water) or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Milk and 100% fruit juice should be consumed within recommended food group amounts and calorie limits. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected if no sugar is added.</p>

<h1>What Should You Avoid or Limit</h1>

<p>Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice can contribute excess calories while providing few or no key nutrients. If they are consumed, amounts should be within overall calorie limits and limits for calories from added sugars. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected, but calories from cream and added sugars should be accounted for in the eating plan.</p>

> Beverage Choices

> TIP:
> <p>Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or nutrient-dense beverages, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice.</p>

### **U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Beverages**

**Question:**  
Rodney is eating lunch at a restaurant and wants to order a beverage. According to the Dietary Guidelines, which two beverages, other than water, are a healthier choice than a soft drink?

| **Beverage Option**        | **Healthy Choice?** | **Rationale**                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Latte coffee with non-fat milk | ✅ Yes               | Contributes beneficial nutrients such as calcium and protein from non-fat milk.                         |
| Fruit drink                | ❌ No                | Typically contains added sugars and few nutrients.                                                     |
| Unsweetened iced tea       | ✅ Yes               | Calorie-free beverage with no added sugars; aligns with healthy beverage guidelines.                   |
| Sports drink               | ❌ No                | Often high in added sugars and not recommended unless for intense physical activity.                   |

**Correct!**  
Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed within the overall daily calorie limits.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

> * <p>Identify healthy-eating strategies based on current dietary guidelines and recommendations.</p>

<p>Knowing the five Dietary Guidelines is important, but more importantly, you need to know how to put the guidelines into practice. In this lesson, you will learn about strategies and resources that you can use to ensure you can align your diet to meet the guidelines and teach your students to do the same.</p>

<h3>Stategy: Use MyPlate</h3>

<p>As you may recall, the first dietary guideline recommends eating healthy by choosing a variety of vegetables, whole fruit and grains, low-fat proteins, and dairy products or fortified soymilk. It also recommends limiting saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars. This is great information, but it does not really tell you how to eat a healthy meal. </p>


# MyPlate — Food Groups

The USDA created **MyPlate** as a tool to help people visualize types of food and how these foods, in combination, make up a healthy meal. According to MyPlate, there are **five food groups**:

- Fruits  
- Vegetables  
- Protein  
- Grains  
- Dairy  

## MyPlate Food Groups and Recommendations

| **Food Group** | **Recommendation** |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 🥦 **Vegetables** | Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. |
| 🍎 **Fruits** | Focus on whole fruits. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. |
| 🌾 **Grains** | Half the grains you eat each day should be whole grains. Whole grains include all three layers of the grain kernel: outer, inner, and middle. |
| 🍗 **Protein** | Vary your protein routine. Choose nutrient-dense proteins from both animal and plant sources. |
| 🥛 **Dairy** | Move to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. The dairy group includes low-fat and fat-free dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, or soymilk. Other plant-based products sold as "milks" may contain added calcium but are not included in the dairy group because their overall nutrient content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages. |

---

## MyPlate Strategies for a Healthy Meal

There are many different strategies that you can use to align the **MyPlate** recommendations with the **Dietary Guidelines**. Aim to:

- Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables.
- Choose whole grains for at least half your grain intake.
- Include a variety of protein foods.
- Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy.
- Limit added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats.

<h1>Strategy: Dietary Guideline Eating Patterns</h1>

<p>The first dietary guideline is to follow a healthy eating pattern over the life span. As you may recall, a healthy eating pattern is based on types and amounts of foods and is designed to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits. The patterns recommend the amount of food to consume from each food group either each day or weekly. Because calorie needs vary based on age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity, the USDA created patterns for 12 different calorie levels. </p>

<img width="328" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe945bc1-a801-43d3-8fd5-f379a8bdf1c8" />

<p>"US Dietary Guidelines" by USDA is in the Public Domain</p>

<p>Review the sample eating pattern for an individual who needs to eat 2,000 calories per day to maintain a certain body weight. </p>

<p>Did you notice that the pattern promotes specific portions of a variety of foods within each food group to meet the calorie needs? The pattern includes a recommended amount of oils and limited calories from low-nutrient foods like added sugars.</p>

<h1>Strategy: Promote Healthy Snacking</h1>

<p>Snacks can be an important part of your diet. They can also help children get the nutrients needed to grow. Snacks can provide energy in the middle of the day or when you exercise. A healthy snack between meals can also decrease your hunger and keep you from overeating at mealtime.</p>

   <p>What makes a healthy snack Review the following suggestions for healthy snacks.</p>

 <ul>
   
  > <li>* Snacks are a part of your overall eating plan and therefore should have nutritional value.</li>
  
  > <li>* Include two or more food groups, especially for children.</li>
  
  > <li>* Aim for fruits, vegetables, whole-grain snacks, and low-fat dairy.</li>
  
  > <li>* Pick foods that are low in added fat and sugar and high in fiber and water. This means an apple is a healthier snack than a bag of chips.</li>
  
  > <li>* Watch the portion size. Help younger children get just enough to satisfy their hunger.</li>
 
  > <li>* Limit foods and drinks that contain added sugar.</li>
 
  > <li>* Choose fresh fruit instead of a fruit-flavored drink.</li>
  
  > <li>* Pair a protein and a carbohydrate to keep you fuller for longer. Examples include having an apple with string cheese or yogurt.</li>

</ul>

> <h3>Smart Snacks in Schools</h3>

>TIP:
><p>As of the 2014–2015 school year, all competitive foods and beverages sold during the school day must meet or exceed Smart Snacks in Schools nutrition standards, which include limits on fat, sugar, sodium, and calorie content. To meet the standards, schools must offer healthier competitive foods for their snacks and à la carte foods and beverages.</p>

<h3>Strategy: Read Nutrition Facts Labels</h3>

<p>People look at food labels for different reasons. One of the most important reasons is to help make quick, informed food choices that contribute to a healthy diet. The information in the main section of the food label contains product-specific information (serving size, calories, and nutrient information) and, therefore, can vary with each food product. All of the nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts Label is based on one serving of the food. </p>

<h1>Module 8</h1>

> <h1>BOOKMARK(pg)[47]</h1>

<p>According to international Food information Council, 36% of Americans follow a specific diet. Many individuals mkae modifications to the recommended dietary guideline to achieve a health goal such as weight loss, to omit foods that cause a negative reaction in teh body, to avoid foods that are not aligned to their religious or ethical b eliefs , or simply to adhere to food preferences. After engaging in this module, you should be able to describe diffrent types of modified diets.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

> <h3>Describe components of common modified diets.</h3>

<p>When you here the word "diet", what comes to mind? About 20 years ago, the word typically referred to a weight loss or therapeutic diet, such as the diabetic diet. However, the meaning expanded to incorporate any type of meal plan that is modified either to meet an indiviual's lifestyle, food preferenced, religious restrictions, or for ethical reasons, in this lesson, you will learn about common modified diets such as vegetarian, low-flat, low-calorie, high-protein, diabetic, and gluten-free diets.</p>

<h1>Vegetarian Diet</h1>
<p>According to a recent nationwide poll, approximately 5% of American adults are vegetarian, and 3% are vegan However, with the popularity of plant-based diets and the avalibility of plant based alternative foods, this number may rise in the coming years. People choose a vegetarian diet for many reasons, including compassion toward animals, enviornmental protection, and risk reduction and management of chronic diseases.</p>

<h3>Spectrum of Vegetarian Diets</h3>
<p>There is a spectrum of vegetarianism. Some individuals refrain from all animals and their products while other will eat eggs, milk, and milk products. Review the following types and descriptions of vegtarian diets.</p>

| Type of Vegetarianism | Foods Restricted or Included |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Vegetarian**        | Restricts flesh foods such as meat (e.g., beef, pork), poultry, wild game, seafood, and fish but may eat their products (e.g., milk, butter, and eggs). |
| **Lacto-ovo vegetarian** | Restricts all flesh foods; eats eggs and dairy products (Lacto and ovo are from the Latin words for milk and egg). |
| **Lacto-vegetarian**  | Restricts all flesh foods; drinks milk and eats milk products. |
| **Ovo-vegetarian**    | Restricts all flesh foods; eats eggs. |
| **Vegan**             | Restricts all flesh foods and their products; may also restrict honey. |
| **Raw vegan**         | Eats vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and sprouted grains; uncooked food consumption varies from 75% to 100%. |

> <h1>Vegan B-12 Requirement</h1>

>TIP:
> <p>Because B-12 is only found in animal prodcuts, vegans need reliable sources of vitamin B-12, such as fortified foods or supplements.</p>

<h3>Therapeutic Diets---High and Low</h3>
<p>A therapeutic diet is a meal plan that controls the intake of certain foods or nutrients to prevent, manage, or treat diseases and disorders. Some diets focus on specific macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—or calories. Other diets, such as the diabetic diet and celiac diet (gluten-free), focus on managing a specific disease.</p>

<h3>Macronutrient and Calorie Diets</h3>
<p>Low-fat, low-calorie, and high-protein diets are all examples of modified diets that focus on macronutrients or calories. Review the following table with a description of these diets.</p>

| Type of Diet       | Focus                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comments                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low-fat**        | Focus on limiting the percentage of calories from fats. | A low-fat diet may also limit saturated fat and cholesterol in addition to total fat. A very low-fat diet is restricted to 15% of daily calories from fat.                                                  | May reduce the occurrence of conditions such as heart disease and obesity.                          |
| **Low-calorie**    | Focus on weight loss by restricting the total number of calories from all sources of macronutrients. | A low-calorie diet restricts the total number of calories consumed compared to the total number of calories needed. The goal is weight loss.                                                               | Promotes weight loss and reduces the occurrence of obesity; may also lower blood pressure.           |
| **High-protein**   | Focus on consuming more protein.                         | A high-protein diet requires a higher percentage of protein consumption compared to the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).                                                                          | Often used by athletes to increase muscle mass; may be unhealthy for some individuals.               |
| **Low-carbohydrate** | Focus on restricting calories and grams of carbohydrates. | There are many variations of this type of diet. A low-carbohydrate diet restricts the intake of carbohydrates (20–60 grams) per day and, therefore, requires a higher intake of fat and protein to obtain calories and nutrients. There is no calorie restriction in this diet. | May produce weight loss; may be unhealthy for some.                                                  |

<h3>Therapeutic Diets---Diebetic and Glueten-Free</h3>
<h4>Diabetic Diet</h4>
<p>In addition to exercise and medication, diabetes can be controlled and managed with a specific meal plan. The focus of a diabetic diet is to control blood glucose (sugar) levels. There are two methods of meal planning: using the MyPlate guidelines or counting carbohydrates. The MyPlate method helps you control your portion sizes. The carbohydrate counting method involves monitoring a specified number of grams of carbohydrates consumed each day.</p>

<p>Both methods control blood sugar levels by restricting foods and beverages with added sugars, limiting the amount of refined carbohydrate foods, and requiring that meals be eaten at regular intervals. Skipping meals causes a fluctuation in blood sugar levels, making it difficult to control. To control blood sugar, individuals on a diabetic diet need to plan the following:</p>

| Plan               | Recommendation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Meal Timing**    | **To maintain even blood sugars:**<br>- Avoid skipping meals.<br>- Eat smaller meals throughout the day. |
| **Portion Sizes**  | **To reduce portion sizes:**<br>- Make half the plate non-starchy vegetables and fruits.<br>- Watch the portion sizes of starchy vegetables and refined grains. |
| **Types of Foods** | **To reduce calorie intake:**<br>- Choose whole grains and high-fiber carbohydrates.<br>- Eat less fat and fatty meats.<br>- Avoid sugars and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages.<br>- Limit fruit juices; eat whole fruit instead. |


> <h3>Diabetes and Blood Sugars</h3>

> <h3>TIP:</h3>
><p>The focus of the diabetic diet is to control blood sugar levels. Some individuals will also need to restrict calories, sodium, and fats to manage other chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>

<h3>Celiac Diet (Gluten-Free)</h3>
<p>Gluten-free diets are popular right now; for most people, it is more of a food preference than a therapeutic diet. Gluten-free diets are essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. Gluten—a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale (a wheat and rye mix)—cannot be digested by individuals with celiac disease, causes an allergic reaction in individuals with wheat allergies, and is not well tolerated with individuals who have gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>To follow a gluten-free diet, individuals must avoid consuming wheat, rye, barley, and products containing gluten—bread, pasta, and cereals. Instead, they should choose substitute grains such as whole oats, millet, and rice that provide nutrients for a healthy diet.</p>

<h3>Food Selectivity</h3>
<p>Food selectivity, although not technically a modified diet, is a type of restricted diet. Some children (and adults) are labeled "picky eaters" because they refuse to try or eat a variety of foods. Although many young children are picky eaters, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder have reported that their children have difficulty with food textures, smells, and tastes. Thus, they may have a very restricted selection of acceptable foods.</p>

<p>Why is this a problem? Picky eating, also referred to as food selectivity, is a significant problem because it may be associated with inadequate nutrition as a result of the restricted diet. It may also cause problems in a social setting and be a stressor in classroom and home settings.</p>

<h3>Religious or Ethical Restrictions</h3>
<p>Dietary considerations for individuals can also be influenced by beliefs. As mentioned above, some people avoid eating meat due to ethical beliefs about the treatment of animals or the environment. Religious beliefs can also influence food choice. For example, some Hindus avoid consuming eggs, fish, meat, and poultry. In some groups in Judaism, certain foods are restricted as well as food preparation methods.</p>

| Description | Correct Modified Diet |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Sara avoids eating wheat, rye, barley, and any products containing these grains. | **Gluten-free diet** |
| Jack eats six small portion-controlled meals. If he skips a meal, he feels light-headed and tired. He also limits refined-carbohydrate foods like pasta and bread and avoids foods and beverages with added sugars. | **Diabetic diet** |
| Maya eats a variety of foods from all of the food groups but in limited portions to help her lose weight. | **Low-calorie diet** |
| Kamal does not eat any beef, pork, poultry, wild game, seafood, fish, dairy products, or eggs. He also does not eat honey because it comes from an animal. | **Vegan** |
| Oliver limits the percentage of calories from fats, including saturated and unsaturated fats. | **Low-fat diet** |
| Eva enjoys a diet that focuses on eating more protein. | **High-protein diet** |
| Lucas does not eat gelatin, okra, mushrooms, jellies, or any type of food that is "slimy." | **Food selectivity** |

## Lesson Summary

Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to describe components of common modified diets. Take a moment to think about what you have learned:

- **Vegetarian**: Restricts flesh foods such as meat, poultry, wild game, seafood, and fish. Some more restricted vegetarians will also exclude dairy products and eggs.  
- **Low-fat diet**: Limits total calories from all fats. Individuals may also limit saturated fat and cholesterol.  
- **Low-calorie diet**: Focuses on a deficit of calories compared to the individual's daily calorie needs to maintain body weight.  
- **High-protein diet**: Focuses on consuming more protein compared to what is recommended by the RDA.  
- **Low-carbohydrate diet**: Restricts the calories and grams of carbohydrates consumed.  
- **Diabetic diet**: Controls blood sugar levels by limiting the intake of foods and beverages with added sugars. Individuals plan portion-sized meals and should not skip meals.  
- **Gluten-free diet**: Avoids wheat, rye, barley, and products containing gluten. Used by individuals with celiac disease or wheat allergies.  
- **Food selectivity**: A restrictive eating pattern typically based on the food's textures, smells, and tastes.  

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe common food allergies and intolerances and their effects on the body.</h3>
<p>One in five children and 32 million Americans have food allergies, and the numbers keep rising. Lactose intolerance, the most common specific food intolerance, affects about 10% of Americans. These individuals need to follow a special diet because their bodies negatively react to the food or nutrient. What is the difference between a food allergy and a food intolerance, and why do you need to know it? In this lesson, you will learn about common food allergies, food intolerances, and their symptoms.</p>

<h1>Food Allergies</h1>
<p>A food allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to foods or beverages that contain a specific food protein. This food is harmless to most people, but to someone who is allergic to the food, it can be life-threatening. According to FoodAllergy.org, "Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That's one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom. About 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food."</p>

<h3>Common Food Allergies</h3>
<p>In the U.S., there are eight foods that cause most food allergy reactions. Review the common food allergies in children and adults.</p>

| Common Food Allergies in Children | Common Food Allergies in Adults |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Eggs                              | Fish                             |
| Milk                              | Peanuts                          |
| Peanuts                           | Shellfish                        |
| Soy                               | Tree nuts                        |
| Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc.) |                                  |
| Wheat                             |                                  |

>Peanut Allergy

>TIP:
><p>The peanut allergy is one of the most common allergies in children. Peanuts are a type of legume and grow underground. They are not the same as tree nuts, which grow on trees. Fortunately, 25% of children will outgrow a peanut allergy. Being allergic to peanuts does not increase the chance of being allergic to tree nuts or another type of legume.</p>

<h3>Food Allergy Reactions and Prevention</h3>
<p>Food allergy reactions always involve the immune system. They can also involve the skin, digestive system, respiratory system, and (in the most serious cases) the cardiovascular system. Symptoms can range from mild (e.g., rashes, hives, itching, swelling) to severe (e.g., trouble breathing, wheezing, loss of consciousness, anaphylaxis ). Life-threatening reactions can occur within minutes and require urgent medical attention. </p>

<h4>Review the following symptoms of food allergies:</h4>

| Non-Life-Threatening Symptoms | Life-Threatening Symptoms (Anaphylaxis) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Itching in and around mouth    | Difficult or noisy breathing; wheezing  |
| Hives or eczema                | Swelling of the tongue                  |
| Nasal congestion, runny nose   | Tightness in throat; difficulty talking |
| Gastrointestinal pains*        | Persistent cough; dizziness or collapse |
|                                | Becoming pale and floppy (in young children) |

*This is not always present.

<h3>Preventing a Food Allergy Reaction</h3>
<p>ood allergy reactions can be alarming. The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is by avoiding the food. Use the following strategies to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the ingredient section of food labels.</li>
  <li>Always ask questions when eating food you have not prepared yourself. </li>
  <li>If you have medication, take it with you wherever you go.</li>
  <li>In the classroom, make sure you know which students have allergies and what types of allergies they are.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Food Intolerance</h1>
<p>Food intolerance, commonly referred to as food sensitivity, is different than food allergies. The differences are based on the body system that triggers the reaction, the severity of the response, and the symptoms. When you have a food allergy, your immune system causes a reaction such as itching, swelling, redness, and pain. If you have a food sensitivity or intolerance, the reaction is started by a chemical reaction, not the immune system. Typically the symptoms are related to the digestive system.</p>
<h3>Causes and Examples of Food Intolerances</h3>
<p>Food sensitivities and intolerances are more common than food allergies. Review the following table of common causes, types of intolerances, and the rationale for why they occur.</p>

| Type of Intolerance      | Example                          | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Lack of enzyme**       | Lactose (milk and milk product) intolerance | The body does not have the right enzymes needed to digest a certain food. For example, the body does not have lactase enzyme to break down lactose sugar. |
| **Additives and preservatives** | Sulfites in wine                 | The body reacts to food additives or preservatives that are not naturally found in a product. |
| **Pharmacological**      | Caffeine (coffee)                | The body is sensitive to naturally found chemicals, such as caffeine or salicylates. This may be genetic. |
| **Sensitivity to macronutrient** | Foods with fermentable sugars (onions, broccoli, or brussels sprouts) | The body is not able to digest these short-chain (simple) fermentable carbohydrates. |

<h3>Food Intolerance Reactions</h3>
<p>The symptoms for a mild to moderate food allergy or intolerance may sometimes be similar, but most of the reactions to food intolerance develop in the digestive system. Food intolerance reactions, unlike a food allergy, are usually related to the amount of the food consumed. While symptoms caused by food intolerance can be immediate, they may take 12 to 24 hours to develop. Symptoms include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gas</li>
  <li>bloating</li>
  <li>diarrhea</li>
  <li>stomach pain or cramping</li>
  <li>constipation</li>
  <li>nausea</li>
</ul>

>Food Allergy versus Food intolerance

>TIP:
>Unlike food allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. A food intolerance is a chemical reaction to a particular food, drink, or nutrient.

## Lesson Activity – Food Allergy vs. Food Intolerance

## Lesson Summary

Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to describe common food allergies and intolerances and their effects on the body:

- **Food allergies** occur when the immune system overreacts to a food or beverage that contains a specific protein.  
  - **Common food allergens**: peanuts, eggs, soy, shellfish, tree nuts.  
  - **Symptoms**: can be mild or life-threatening; may include difficulty breathing, difficulty talking, itching, swelling, redness, diarrhea, and loss of consciousness.

- **Food intolerance** is caused by a chemical reaction to a specific type of food; it is **not** an immune reaction.  
  - **Common food intolerances**: milk and milk products, foods or beverages with sulfites or caffeine, vegetables with non-fermentable simple carbohydrates.  
  - **Symptoms**: bloating, cramping, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation.

<h3>Take a moment to think about what you have learned in this module:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals modify their diets to achieve a health goal, to manage a disease, or to avoid a negative reaction to foods. They may also choose these diets for ethical or religious reasons or because of their food preferences. </li>
  <li>Types of modified diets include the vegetarian, low-fat, low-calorie, high-protein, low-carbohydrate, gluten-free, diabetic, food allergy restricted, and food intolerance diets.</li>
</ul>

## Lesson Activity – Modified Diets

| Question | Scenario | Correct Answer | Explanation |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Q1** | Carl avoids eating milk and yogurt because it causes stomach pain and bloating. | **Food intolerance** | Carl has lactose intolerance, meaning he lacks the enzyme needed to break down lactose sugar in dairy products. |
| **Q2** | Mia is an athlete who is trying to increase her muscle mass. She eats more protein at lunch and dinner and drinks protein shakes for snacks. | **High-protein diet** | A high-protein diet focuses on consuming more protein than the RDA to support muscle growth. |
| **Q3** | Lucas has celiac disease and needs to avoid wheat, rye, and barley. | **Gluten-free diet** | A gluten-free diet eliminates wheat, rye, barley, and foods made from them to manage celiac disease. |

<h1>MODULE 9</h1>

<p>According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), more than 70.2% of adults are overweight or have obesity, and 1 in 6 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 are obese. Do these statistics surprise you? They should! These numbers continue to rise. The good news is that there are solutions to stop this upward trend. After engaging in this module, you should be able to describe the benefits of and the strategies for maintaining a healthy body weight.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe the benefits of maintaining a healthy body weight and the use of BMI to assess it.</h3>

<h1>Benefits of Healthy Body Weight</h1>
<p>Maintaining a healthy body weight is good for your physical, social, and emotional health. A healthy body weight reduces the risk of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cardiovascular disease and diabetes</li>
  <li>some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver)</li>
  <li>infertility</li>
  <li>sleep apnea</li>
  <li>asthma</li>
  <li>arthritis and gallstones</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assessing a Healthy Body Weight—BMI</h1>

<p>Using the scale alone is not a good indicator of a healthy weight because it doesn't account for an individual's height. One model that can help give a more complete view of health is BMI (body mass index). Adult BMI opens a new window is used as a screening tool to evaluate whether an individual is overweight or obese. BMI is calculated the same way for both adults and children: weight x 703 ÷ height2. If an individual's weight is higher than what is considered a healthy weight for a given height, it is described as overweight or obese. 

Use this Adult BMI calculator opens a new window to determine your BMI. To manually calculate your BMI, use this formula: weight (lb) x 703 ÷ height (in)</p>

<h3>BMI and Body Fatness</h3>
<p>It is important to note that BMI does not measure body fat directly, but the correlation between BMI and body fatness is strong. BMI seems to be more accurate as an indicator of body fatness with higher levels of BMI. In addition, two people can have the same BMI, but their level of body fatness may differ. For example, an athlete may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.</p>
<p>BMI is one way to model healthy weight, but it does not include all factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Additional information and evaluation by a health professional can provide a more complete picture of a healthy weight for an individual.</p>

<h1>BMI Interpretation</h1>
<h4>Adults</h4>
<p>For adults 20 years old and older, BMI is interpreted using standard weight status categories. These categories are the same for men and women of all body types and ages. The standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults are shown in the following table</p>

| BMI Range    | Weight Status   |
|--------------|-----------------|
| < 18.5       | Underweight     |
| 18.5 – 24.9  | Healthy weight  |
| 25.0 – 29.9  | Overweight      |
| > 30.0       | Obese           |


<h3>Children and Adolescents</h3>
<p>MI is interpreted differently for children and teens than for adults. The health professional will calculate the BMI using the same formula as the adult. Then the BMI is plotted on the BMI-for-age percentile growth charts. This extra step is necessary because weight and height change during growth and development, as does the relation to body fatness. A child's BMI must be interpreted relative to other children of the same sex and age.</p>

| Percentile Range | Weight Status   |
|------------------|-----------------|
| < 5%             | Underweight     |
| 5% – 85%         | Healthy weight  |
| 85% – 95%        | Overweight      |
| > 95%            | Obese           |


<p>For children and teens, BMI is only used to screen for potential weight- and health-related issues. It is not a diagnostic tool. For example, a child may have a high BMI for his or her age and sex, but to determine if excess fat is a problem, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments.

Use this Children and Teen BMI calculator opens a new window to determine the BMI of a child or adolescent.2</p>

> <h1>Children's and Teens' BMI</h1>

>TIP:
> <p>The BMI formula is the same as it is for adults, but the classification of weight status is based on BMI-for-age percentiles. You do not need to memorize the classifications; just know how the BMI is calculated and interpreted.</p>

## Lesson Summary

- Maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risks of chronic diseases and conditions, and positively impacts social and emotional health.  
- Total body weight consists of lean body mass (water, bone, muscle, organs) and fat mass. Excess fat increases risk for chronic diseases.  
- BMI is a screening tool used to evaluate a person's weight status; it **does not** measure body fat. Categories include underweight, normal (healthy) weight, overweight, and obese.  
- BMI calculation is the same for adults and children:  
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (lbs)} \times 703}{\text{height (in)}^2}
  \]
- Adults with BMI ≥ 25 are considered overweight or obese.  
- For children and teens, BMI is interpreted using BMI-for-age percentiles rather than direct BMI ranges.

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe healthy weight management strategies.</h3>

<p>Have you ever been on a weight-loss diet? If so, you know how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off. There are many factors that make it difficult to maintain a healthy body weight, including genes, eating habits, physical activity, screen time (e.g., TV, computer, phone), sleep habits, medical conditions or medications, and access to healthy foods and safe places to be active. In this lesson, you will learn about what calorie (energy) balance is, how to estimate daily calorie needs, and which strategies you can implement to maintain a healthy body weight.</p>

<h1>Energy (Calorie) Balance</h1>
<p>When it comes to maintaining a healthy weight for a lifetime, the bottom line is that calories count. Weight management is all about balance—balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses, or "burns." As you know, a calorie is defined as a unit of energy supplied by food. A calorie is a calorie regardless of its source. Whether you're eating carbohydrates, fats, sugars, or proteins, they all contain calories.</p>

<h3>Caloric Balance</h3>
<p>Caloric balance is like a scale. To remain in balance and maintain your body weight, the calories consumed from food must be balanced by the calories used through normal body functions, daily activities, and exercise.</p>

| If You Are…          | Your Caloric Balance Is… | How It Works                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maintaining your weight | In balance              | You are eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using. Your weight will remain stable. |
| Gaining weight         | In caloric excess       | You are eating more calories than your body is using. Your body stores these extra calories as fat, leading to weight gain. |
| Losing weight          | In caloric deficit      | You are eating fewer calories than you are using. Your body pulls from fat stores for energy, causing weight loss. |

<h3>Calories to Maintain Weight: Adults</h3>
<p>The number of calories an individual needs each day depends on the individual's age, gender, weight, height, and amount and type of exercise. Typically, adult women need 1,600–2,400 calories per day, and adult men need 2,000–3,000 calories per day. Inactive adults are at the lower calorie range. Calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.</p>

<h3>Calories for Growth and Development: Children and Adolescents</h3>
<p>The estimated number of calories for children ranges from 1,000–2,000 calories per day for younger children up to 1,400–3,200 calories per day for adolescents. Boys generally have higher calorie needs than girls. </p>

<h3>Calories to Lose Weight</h3>
<p>To lose one pound of body fat, you would need to take in approximately 3,500 calories below your calorie needs. To lose about one to two pounds in a week, you will need a calorie deficit of 500–1000 calories per day. This can be achieved by eating fewer calories, being more physically active, or both. For example, to lose one pound in a week, eat 250 fewer calories and burn 250 calories through exercise each day. Use the online MyPlate Plan Calculator opens a new window to determine your daily calorie needs.</p>

<h1>Weight Management Strategies</h1>
<p>When it comes to weight loss, there are many fad diets promising fast results. But such diets can limit your nutritional intake, can be unhealthy, and tend to fail in the long run. The key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight isn't about short-term dietary changes. It's about a lifestyle choice that includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, and balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When losing weight, more physical activity increases the number of calories your body burns for energy. </li>
  <li>The burning of calories through physical activity, combined with reducing the number of calories you eat, creates a "calorie deficit" that results in weight loss.</li>
  <li>Evidence shows the only way to maintain weight loss is to be engaged in regular physical activity.</li>
  <li>Physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes beyond that produced by weight reduction alone.</li>

<h1>Weight Management Strategy: Healthy Eating</h1>
<h3>Strategy: It's All About Balance</h3>
<p>Do you have to give up your favorite comfort food? No! Healthy eating is all about balance. You can enjoy your favorite foods even if they are high in calories, fat, or added sugars. Some general tips for high-fat and high-calorie foods include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eat comfort foods less often. </li>
  <li>eat smaller amounts. </li>
  <li>try a lower-calorie version. </li>
  <li>add more non-starchy vegetables.</li>
  <li>avoid added fats.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy: Rethink Your Drink</h3>
<p>Many people don't realize just how many calories beverages can contribute to their daily calorie intake. The good news is that you have plenty of options for reducing the number of calories in what you drink.</p>

| Higher Calorie Beverage                 | Lower Calorie Alternative             |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Medium whole milk café latte (265 calories) | Medium non-fat milk café latte (125 calories) |
| Regular soft drink: 20 ounce (227 calories)  | Seltzer or diet soft drink (0 calories)        |
| Sweetened iced tea: 16 ounce (180 calories)  | Sparkling water with lemon (0 calories)        |

<h1>Strategy: Watch Out for Added Sugar</h1>
<p>Sweeteners that add calories go by many different names. Some common caloric sweeteners are listed below. If these appear in the ingredients list of your favorite beverage or food, you know the food or drink has been sweetened with sugar.</p>

<ul>
  <li>high-fructose corn syrup; corn syrup</li>
  <li>fructose</li>
  <li>fruit juice concentrates</li>
  <li>sugar</li>
  <li>sucrose (table sugar)</li>
  <li>dextrose </li>
  <li>malt</li>
</ul>

> <h3>How to Spot a Sugar</h3>

> <h3>TIP:</h3>
> <p>When reading food labels, look for ingredients ending in -ose, such as dextrose or fructose, because they are a sugar or form of carbohydrate.</p>

<h1>Weight Management Strategy: Portion Control</h1>
<p>Research shows that people unintentionally consume more calories when faced with larger portions. This can mean significant excess calorie intake, especially when eating high-calorie foods. Here are some tips to help you avoid some common portion-size pitfalls.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eating out: Split an entrée with a friend, or ask for a to-go box and wrap up half your meal when it is brought to the tab</li>
  <li>Eating in: Serve the food on individual small plates instead of putting the serving dishes on the table.</li>
  <li>Eating in front of the TV: Try to avoid eating while watching TV. If you really need to eat in front of the TV, put the amount that you plan to eat into a small bowl or container instead of eating straight from the package. </li>
  <li>Snack: If you feel hungry between meals, eat a healthy snack, like a piece of fruit or small salad, to avoid overeating during your next meal.2</li>
</ul>

<h1>MODULE 10 (PG)[57]</h1>

<p>Nearly 100,000 schools and institutions serve school lunches to 29.8 million students each day. Students who participate in school breakfast programs have higher standardized test scores and lower levels of absenteeism. Over 30% of deaths from foodborne illness occur in children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The United States government supports the health of children with federally funded school food nutrition programs, training, and nutrition resources. It also establishes food safety guidelines to prevent foodborne illnesses. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify school food programs and basic principles of food safety.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h3>Describe the national school food and wellness programs and their benefits.</h3>

<p>School food programs are critical to student health and well-being, especially for low-income students. They ensure that students have the nutrition they need throughout the day to learn. Research shows that receiving free or reduced-price school lunches reduces food insecurity, obesity rates, and poor health. In this lesson, you will learn about the national school food programs and other government programs that promote the health of children through healthy nutrition practices.</p>

<h3>School Breakfast and Lunch Programs</h3>

<p>The School Breakfast Program
Founded in 1966, the School Breakfast Program (SBP) provides nutritious breakfast meals to students at participating schools. There are three kinds of meals students may be eligible for: free meals, reduced-price breakfast, and full-price (paid) meals based upon the family's income.</p>

<h3>Is the Program Effective? </h3>

<p>Over 91,000 schools and 15 million students are participating in the SBP as of 20201. This includes full-, reduced- and free-priced meals. Research demonstrates that the SBP increases both nutrition for students and cognitive achievement while reducing food insecurity 2. It is possible that improved nutrition provides some of the micronutrients critical for brain development and the neurological processes of learning. </p>

<h3>The School Lunch Program</h3>

<p>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), like the SBP, is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential childcare institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost, no-cost and full-priced lunches to children each school day. The program serves approximately 30 million children each year as of 2022</p>

<h3>What about Snacks? </h3>
<p>School food authorities can also be reimbursed for snacks served to children who participate in an approved educational afterschool program.</p>

<h3>How Do the Programs Work?</h3>

<p>he programs are generally operated by public or nonprofit private schools of high school grade or below. Participating school districts and independent schools receive cash subsidies and USDA foods for each reimbursable meal they serve. In exchange, NSLP institutions must serve lunches that meet federal meal pattern requirements and offer the lunches and breakfasts at a free or reduced price to eligible children.</p>

<h3>Are the Meals Nutritious?</h3>

<p>Schools participating in the NSLP and SBP require participating schools to offer nutritious meals meeting the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. The meal patterns are based on the MyPlate food groups—fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and fluid milk—in portions appropriate for the child's age. In adherence to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the meals limit sodium and saturated fats and do not allow any foods with trans fat or minimal nutritional value</p>

<h3>Team Nutrition</h3>

<p>Team Nutrition, an initiative of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, supports the NSLP and SBP by providing nutrition training and educational resources to schools, childcare settings, and summer meal sites that participate in these programs.</p>

<h3>What Resources Are Available? </h3>

<p>Team Nutrition helps communicate messages using MyPlate to prompt students to build a healthy plate at mealtime. The program offers a variety of resources, including lesson plans, hands-on activities, videos, and graphics that teachers can use if their schools participate in the NSLP. View the Team Nutrition Resource Catalog opens a new window.</p>

<h1>School Wellness Programs</h1>

<p>Schools play an important role in promoting the health and safety of children and adolescents by helping them establish lifelong health patterns. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Healthy Schools works with states, school systems, communities, and national partners to prevent chronic diseases and promote the health and well-being of children and adolescents in schools. </p>

<p>A major initiative of CDC Healthy Schools is to work with school districts to develop a local school wellness program and accompanying policies. The policies must address the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategies for nutrition promotion and education, physical activity, and other school-based activities that promote student wellness</li>
  <li>Nutrition guidelines for all foods sold on each school campus during the school day </li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
> Identify common food safety techniques at home and at school.

<p>Did you know that 1 in 6 Americans get sick from food poisoning each year? Nearly 125,000 young children under the age of five die from foodborne diseases every year. Just one tiny bacterium can grow to over 2,097,152 bacteria in seven hours when kept at room temperature. How can you prevent getting ill from contaminated food? It's easy! In this lesson, you will learn about the four steps to prevent foodborne illness: clean, separate, cook, and chill.</p>

**Which three cleaning strategies should Lora tell her students to use?**

- Use antimicrobial soap and cold water.
- Wash your hands after blowing your nose.
- Wash an apple before eating it.
- Wash your hands before and after handling food.

**Correct Answer:**  
Wash hands with **warm, soapy water** for 20 seconds before and after handling food and after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or handling pets. Wash fruits and produce (but **not** meat or animal products) before eating. Antibacterial soap does **not** remove bacteria any better than plain soap.

---

## 2. Preventing Cross-Contamination

**Which two strategies should be used to prevent cross-contamination?**

- Place produce on top of raw meat in the refrigerator.
- Cook chicken and vegetables separately.
- Use different cutting boards when cutting chicken and vegetables.
- Wash the knife before using it to cut vegetables.

**Correct Answer:**  
When handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs, keep these foods and their juices away from ready-to-eat foods. Clean cutting boards and knives after cutting animal products. Chicken and vegetables **can** be cooked together as long as the chicken is cooked to the required temperature.

---

## 3. Strategies to Kill Bacteria During Cooking

**Which three strategies should be used to kill bacteria during cooking?**

- Reheat foods if left out for three or more hours.
- Keep food hot after cooking.
- Microwave food thoroughly.
- Use a thermometer to check the internal temperature.

**Correct Answer:**  
Food is safely cooked when the internal temperature is high enough to kill germs that can make you sick. Use a thermometer and cooking temperature charts to ensure the internal temperature is reached. Keep food hot after cooking, and microwave food thoroughly. Do **not** reheat food left out too long.

---

## 4. What to Do with a Sandwich Left Out for Five Hours

**Sophia is attending a meeting tonight after work. She brought a ham and cheese sandwich from home for dinner. She accidentally left the sandwich on her desk for five hours. What should she do with the sandwich?**

- Heat it in a microwave.
- Throw it out.
- Ask the cafeteria staff to put it in the quick-chill refrigerator.
- Put it in the refrigerator and eat it for dinner.

**Correct Answer:**  
Because bacteria grow rapidly at room temperature, perishable food like cold-cut meats and cheese should be **thrown out** if left at room temperature for more than two hours. Reheating the sandwich may not kill all the bacteria. Putting the sandwich into the refrigerator will only stop bacterial growth; it will not kill bacteria already present.

## Lesson Summary

<h1>Module 7</h1>

<p>Although 59% of Americans align their food choices with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, individuals in the United States spend $14 billion each year in obesity-related medical costs, $245 billion for type 2 diabetes, and $316 billion for heart disease, all of which may be prevented through a healthy diet. Why doesn't everyone eat healthy? It may be that 8 in 10 Americans think advice about what to eat is conflicting. It may also be due to cultural beliefs, lack of resources, or simply that many unhealthy foods taste good.</p>
<br>

  <p>In this module, you will use your knowledge of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to better understand the food choices that make up a healthy eating pattern. More specifically, you will explore the general U.S. Dietary Guidelines and key recommendations for healthy eating. You will learn about the tools available to monitor your eating patterns and teach others how to monitor theirs. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify components of a healthy diet.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h2>Identify the dietary guidelines and key recommendations for a healthy diet</h2>

<p>About 117 million individuals have one or more preventable chronic diseases. More than two-thirds of adults and nearly one-third of children and youth are overweight or obese. The good news is that these diseases can be preventable through healthy eating.</p>

<h3>In this lesson, you will learn about the dietary recommendations for a healthy diet.</h3>

<h1>General U.S Dietary Guidlines at a Glance</h1>

<p>What exactly is healthy eating? Every five years, U.S. Health and Human Services revises the U.S. Dietary Guidelines that provide recommendations for healthy eating to promote overall health and help prevent chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines consist of general guidelines and key recommendations to help prevent diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. There are five general guidelines that encourage eating healthy.</p>


<h1>Recommendation 1: Follow a Healthy Eating Pattern across the Life Span</h1>

<p>Develop a healthy eating pattern of consuming foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed. All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories. All forms of foods—including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen—can be included in healthy eating patterns.</p>

<h1>What dose a Healthy Eating Pattern include and Limit</h1>

> <h3>A healthy eating pattern includes the following:</h3>

> <h3> A variety of vegetables from all subgroups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dark green vegetables</li>
  <li>Red and orange vegetables</li>
  <li>Legumes (e.g beans, and peas)</li>
  <li>Starchy vegetables (e.g corn, potatoes)</li>
  
  > <h3>Others</h3>
  
  <li>Fruits, especially whole fruits</li>
  <li>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</li>
  <li>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages</li>
  <li>A variety of profein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy prodcuts</li>
  <li>Oils (e.g Canola, Olive)</li>
  
  > <h3>A healthy eating pattern limits the following:</h3>
  
  <li>Saturated fats</li>
  <li>Trans fats</li>
  <li>Added sugars</li>
  <li>Soduim</li>
</ul>

---

<h1>Recommendation 2: Focus on Variety, Nutrient Density, and Amount</h1>
<p>choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods from each food group in recommended amounts. Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins, minerals, and other substances with little or no solid fats and added sugars, refined starches, or sodium.</p>

<h3>Example of nutrient-dense food choices include the following:</h3>

| **CHOOSE THIS FOOD**                       | **INSTEAD OF THIS FOOD**                      | **RATIONALE**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh fruit (80–100 calories)             | 1 cup fruit juice drink (140 calories)<br>12 ounces sweetened sugar drinks (160 calories) | Whole fruit has fiber not found in fruit juice or sweetened beverages. Unlike whole fruit, sweetened sugar drinks do not have any vitamins or minerals.         |
| Skinless grilled chicken breast (31 calories per ounce) | Chicken nuggets (85 calories per ounce)        | Chicken nuggets have more calories, saturated fat, and sodium than grilled chicken.                                                                             |
| 1 cup kale and quinoa salad (190 calories)| 1 cup Caesar salad with romaine lettuce (180 calories) | The calories of these salads are almost the same, but the kale and quinoa have more nutrient value. Kale has vitamins A, C, and K and fiber. Quinoa is a complete protein rich in fiber, iron, zinc, B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. |

---

<h1>Recommendation 3: Limit Sugars and Saturated Fats and Reduce Sodium Intake</h1>

<p>Consume food low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within a healthy eating pattern. 

For example, added sugars are found in sodas, soft drinks, and processed baked goods. Saturated and trans fats are found in ice cream and fast food like hamburgers. Pizza and sliced processed meats for sandwiches have high levels of sodium. </p>

<h1>Recommendation 4: Shift to Healthier Food and Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>Replace typical food and beverage choices with more nutrient-dense options. Be sure to consider personal preferences to maintain shifts over time. 

For example, instead of fettuccine alfredo — a pasta dish with refined grains and high-fat dairy—choose pasta primavera made with whole-grain pasta, vegetables, and a small amount of olive oil.</p>

<h1>Recommendation 5: Support Healthy Eating Patterns in all Situations</h1>

<p>Everyone has a role in creating and supporting healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to community. As a teacher, you will have an important role supporting children and teaching them both how to make healthy food choices and what the impact is of nutrition on physical and emotional health.</p>

<h1>Best Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>When you think about your overall food intake, it is easy to forget that the beverages you drink are part of your diet. In fact, they account for almost 20% of total calorie intake. When it comes to beverages, the largest source of calories is sweetened beverages, accounting for 35% of calories. For these reasons and others, the recent Dietary Guidelines included beverages as part of the eating pattern.</p>

<p>Beverages vary in their nutrient and calorie content. Some, like water, do not contain any calories. Others, like soft drinks, contain calories but little nutritional value. Finally, drinks like milk and fruit and vegetable juices contain important nutrients such as calcium, potassium, and vitamin D in addition to calories.</p>

<p>Beverages make a substantial contribution to total water needs and to nutrient and calorie intakes in most typical eating patterns. In fact, other major sources of calories from beverages are milk and milk drinks, alcoholic beverages, fruit and vegetable juices, and coffee and tea. </p>

<h1>What Should You Drink?</h1>

<p>Beverages that are calorie-free (especially water) or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Milk and 100% fruit juice should be consumed within recommended food group amounts and calorie limits. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected if no sugar is added.</p>

<h1>What Should You Avoid or Limit</h1>

<p>Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice can contribute excess calories while providing few or no key nutrients. If they are consumed, amounts should be within overall calorie limits and limits for calories from added sugars. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected, but calories from cream and added sugars should be accounted for in the eating plan.</p>

> Beverage Choices

> TIP:
> <p>Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or nutrient-dense beverages, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice.</p>

### **U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Beverages**

**Question:**  
Rodney is eating lunch at a restaurant and wants to order a beverage. According to the Dietary Guidelines, which two beverages, other than water, are a healthier choice than a soft drink?

| **Beverage Option**        | **Healthy Choice?** | **Rationale**                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Latte coffee with non-fat milk | ✅ Yes               | Contributes beneficial nutrients such as calcium and protein from non-fat milk.                         |
| Fruit drink                | ❌ No                | Typically contains added sugars and few nutrients.                                                     |
| Unsweetened iced tea       | ✅ Yes               | Calorie-free beverage with no added sugars; aligns with healthy beverage guidelines.                   |
| Sports drink               | ❌ No                | Often high in added sugars and not recommended unless for intense physical activity.                   |

**Correct!**  
Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed within the overall daily calorie limits.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

> * <p>Identify healthy-eating strategies based on current dietary guidelines and recommendations.</p>

<p>Knowing the five Dietary Guidelines is important, but more importantly, you need to know how to put the guidelines into practice. In this lesson, you will learn about strategies and resources that you can use to ensure you can align your diet to meet the guidelines and teach your students to do the same.</p>

<h3>Stategy: Use MyPlate</h3>

<p>As you may recall, the first dietary guideline recommends eating healthy by choosing a variety of vegetables, whole fruit and grains, low-fat proteins, and dairy products or fortified soymilk. It also recommends limiting saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars. This is great information, but it does not really tell you how to eat a healthy meal. </p>


# MyPlate — Food Groups

The USDA created **MyPlate** as a tool to help people visualize types of food and how these foods, in combination, make up a healthy meal. According to MyPlate, there are **five food groups**:

- Fruits  
- Vegetables  
- Protein  
- Grains  
- Dairy  

## MyPlate Food Groups and Recommendations

| **Food Group** | **Recommendation** |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 🥦 **Vegetables** | Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. |
| 🍎 **Fruits** | Focus on whole fruits. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. |
| 🌾 **Grains** | Half the grains you eat each day should be whole grains. Whole grains include all three layers of the grain kernel: outer, inner, and middle. |
| 🍗 **Protein** | Vary your protein routine. Choose nutrient-dense proteins from both animal and plant sources. |
| 🥛 **Dairy** | Move to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. The dairy group includes low-fat and fat-free dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, or soymilk. Other plant-based products sold as "milks" may contain added calcium but are not included in the dairy group because their overall nutrient content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages. |

## MyPlate Strategies for a Healthy Meal

There are many different strategies that you can use to align the **MyPlate** recommendations with the **Dietary Guidelines**. Aim to:

- Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables.
- Choose whole grains for at least half your grain intake.
- Include a variety of protein foods.
- Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy.
- Limit added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats.

<h1>Strategy: Dietary Guideline Eating Patterns</h1>

<p>The first dietary guideline is to follow a healthy eating pattern over the life span. As you may recall, a healthy eating pattern is based on types and amounts of foods and is designed to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits. The patterns recommend the amount of food to consume from each food group either each day or weekly. Because calorie needs vary based on age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity, the USDA created patterns for 12 different calorie levels. </p>

<h1>Module 7</h1>

<p>Although 59% of Americans align their food choices with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, individuals in the United States spend $14 billion each year in obesity-related medical costs, $245 billion for type 2 diabetes, and $316 billion for heart disease, all of which may be prevented through a healthy diet. Why doesn't everyone eat healthy? It may be that 8 in 10 Americans think advice about what to eat is conflicting. It may also be due to cultural beliefs, lack of resources, or simply that many unhealthy foods taste good.</p>
<br>

  <p>In this module, you will use your knowledge of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to better understand the food choices that make up a healthy eating pattern. More specifically, you will explore the general U.S. Dietary Guidelines and key recommendations for healthy eating. You will learn about the tools available to monitor your eating patterns and teach others how to monitor theirs. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify components of a healthy diet.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h2>Identify the dietary guidelines and key recommendations for a healthy diet</h2>

<p>About 117 million individuals have one or more preventable chronic diseases. More than two-thirds of adults and nearly one-third of children and youth are overweight or obese. The good news is that these diseases can be preventable through healthy eating.</p>

<h3>In this lesson, you will learn about the dietary recommendations for a healthy diet.</h3>

<h1>General U.S Dietary Guidlines at a Glance</h1>

<p>What exactly is healthy eating? Every five years, U.S. Health and Human Services revises the U.S. Dietary Guidelines that provide recommendations for healthy eating to promote overall health and help prevent chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines consist of general guidelines and key recommendations to help prevent diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. There are five general guidelines that encourage eating healthy.</p>


<h1>Recommendation 1: Follow a Healthy Eating Pattern across the Life Span</h1>

<p>Develop a healthy eating pattern of consuming foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed. All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories. All forms of foods—including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen—can be included in healthy eating patterns.</p>

<h1>What dose a Healthy Eating Pattern include and Limit</h1>

> <h3>A healthy eating pattern includes the following:</h3>

> <h3> A variety of vegetables from all subgroups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dark green vegetables</li>
  <li>Red and orange vegetables</li>
  <li>Legumes (e.g beans, and peas)</li>
  <li>Starchy vegetables (e.g corn, potatoes)</li>
  
  > <h3>Others</h3>
  
  <li>Fruits, especially whole fruits</li>
  <li>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</li>
  <li>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages</li>
  <li>A variety of profein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy prodcuts</li>
  <li>Oils (e.g Canola, Olive)</li>
  
  > <h3>A healthy eating pattern limits the following:</h3>
  
  <li>Saturated fats</li>
  <li>Trans fats</li>
  <li>Added sugars</li>
  <li>Soduim</li>
</ul>

---

<h1>Recommendation 2: Focus on Variety, Nutrient Density, and Amount</h1>
<p>choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods from each food group in recommended amounts. Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins, minerals, and other substances with little or no solid fats and added sugars, refined starches, or sodium.</p>

<h3>Example of nutrient-dense food choices include the following:</h3>

| **CHOOSE THIS FOOD**                       | **INSTEAD OF THIS FOOD**                      | **RATIONALE**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh fruit (80–100 calories)             | 1 cup fruit juice drink (140 calories)<br>12 ounces sweetened sugar drinks (160 calories) | Whole fruit has fiber not found in fruit juice or sweetened beverages. Unlike whole fruit, sweetened sugar drinks do not have any vitamins or minerals.         |
| Skinless grilled chicken breast (31 calories per ounce) | Chicken nuggets (85 calories per ounce)        | Chicken nuggets have more calories, saturated fat, and sodium than grilled chicken.                                                                             |
| 1 cup kale and quinoa salad (190 calories)| 1 cup Caesar salad with romaine lettuce (180 calories) | The calories of these salads are almost the same, but the kale and quinoa have more nutrient value. Kale has vitamins A, C, and K and fiber. Quinoa is a complete protein rich in fiber, iron, zinc, B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. |

---

<h1>Recommendation 3: Limit Sugars and Saturated Fats and Reduce Sodium Intake</h1>

<p>Consume food low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within a healthy eating pattern. 

For example, added sugars are found in sodas, soft drinks, and processed baked goods. Saturated and trans fats are found in ice cream and fast food like hamburgers. Pizza and sliced processed meats for sandwiches have high levels of sodium. </p>

<h1>Recommendation 4: Shift to Healthier Food and Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>Replace typical food and beverage choices with more nutrient-dense options. Be sure to consider personal preferences to maintain shifts over time. 

For example, instead of fettuccine alfredo — a pasta dish with refined grains and high-fat dairy—choose pasta primavera made with whole-grain pasta, vegetables, and a small amount of olive oil.</p>

---

<h1>Recommendation 5: Support Healthy Eating Patterns in all Situations</h1>

<p>Everyone has a role in creating and supporting healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to community. As a teacher, you will have an important role supporting children and teaching them both how to make healthy food choices and what the impact is of nutrition on physical and emotional health.</p>

# Did I Get This - Question 1

| **Scenario** | **Dietary Guideline** | **Explanation** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Jay and his wife have two children... They eat more low-fat meat, use oils, herbs, and whole fruits. | **Follow a healthy eating pattern across the life span** | Correct! Jay and his family are choosing healthy foods for proper growth, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting added sugar and sodium. |
| Ellen eats fruits, vegetables, low-fat protein daily, and controls portion sizes to avoid weight gain. | **Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount** | Correct! Ellen focuses on nutrient-dense foods and portion sizes to maintain her body weight. |

| Helga teaches her students about Dietary Guidelines and healthy choices. | **Support healthy eating patterns in all situations** | Correct! Helga is promoting healthy eating patterns through education and guidance. |

<h1>Best Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>When you think about your overall food intake, it is easy to forget that the beverages you drink are part of your diet. In fact, they account for almost 20% of total calorie intake. When it comes to beverages, the largest source of calories is sweetened beverages, accounting for 35% of calories. For these reasons and others, the recent Dietary Guidelines included beverages as part of the eating pattern.</p>

<p>Beverages vary in their nutrient and calorie content. Some, like water, do not contain any calories. Others, like soft drinks, contain calories but little nutritional value. Finally, drinks like milk and fruit and vegetable juices contain important nutrients such as calcium, potassium, and vitamin D in addition to calories.</p>

<p>Beverages make a substantial contribution to total water needs and to nutrient and calorie intakes in most typical eating patterns. In fact, other major sources of calories from beverages are milk and milk drinks, alcoholic beverages, fruit and vegetable juices, and coffee and tea. </p>

<h1>What Should You Drink?</h1>

<p>Beverages that are calorie-free (especially water) or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Milk and 100% fruit juice should be consumed within recommended food group amounts and calorie limits. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected if no sugar is added.</p>

<h1>What Should You Avoid or Limit</h1>

<p>Sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice can contribute excess calories while providing few or no key nutrients. If they are consumed, amounts should be within overall calorie limits and limits for calories from added sugars. Coffee, tea, and flavored waters also can be selected, but calories from cream and added sugars should be accounted for in the eating plan.</p>

> Beverage Choices

> TIP:
> <p>Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or nutrient-dense beverages, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks that are less than 100% juice.</p>

### **U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Beverages**

**Question:**  
Rodney is eating lunch at a restaurant and wants to order a beverage. According to the Dietary Guidelines, which two beverages, other than water, are a healthier choice than a soft drink?

| **Beverage Option**        | **Healthy Choice?** | **Rationale**                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Latte coffee with non-fat milk | ✅ Yes               | Contributes beneficial nutrients such as calcium and protein from non-fat milk.                         |
| Fruit drink                | ❌ No                | Typically contains added sugars and few nutrients.                                                     |
| Unsweetened iced tea       | ✅ Yes               | Calorie-free beverage with no added sugars; aligns with healthy beverage guidelines.                   |
| Sports drink               | ❌ No                | Often high in added sugars and not recommended unless for intense physical activity.                   |

**Correct!**  
Beverages that are calorie-free—especially water—or that contribute beneficial nutrients, such as fat-free and low-fat milk and 100% juice, should be the primary beverages consumed within the overall daily calorie limits.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

> * <p>Identify healthy-eating strategies based on current dietary guidelines and recommendations.</p>

<p>Knowing the five Dietary Guidelines is important, but more importantly, you need to know how to put the guidelines into practice. In this lesson, you will learn about strategies and resources that you can use to ensure you can align your diet to meet the guidelines and teach your students to do the same.</p>

<h3>Stategy: Use MyPlate</h3>

<p>As you may recall, the first dietary guideline recommends eating healthy by choosing a variety of vegetables, whole fruit and grains, low-fat proteins, and dairy products or fortified soymilk. It also recommends limiting saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars. This is great information, but it does not really tell you how to eat a healthy meal. </p>


# MyPlate — Food Groups

The USDA created **MyPlate** as a tool to help people visualize types of food and how these foods, in combination, make up a healthy meal. According to MyPlate, there are **five food groups**:

- Fruits  
- Vegetables  
- Protein  
- Grains  
- Dairy  

## MyPlate Food Groups and Recommendations

| **Food Group** | **Recommendation** |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 🥦 **Vegetables** | Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. |
| 🍎 **Fruits** | Focus on whole fruits. Whole fruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. |
| 🌾 **Grains** | Half the grains you eat each day should be whole grains. Whole grains include all three layers of the grain kernel: outer, inner, and middle. |
| 🍗 **Protein** | Vary your protein routine. Choose nutrient-dense proteins from both animal and plant sources. |
| 🥛 **Dairy** | Move to low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. The dairy group includes low-fat and fat-free dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, or soymilk. Other plant-based products sold as "milks" may contain added calcium but are not included in the dairy group because their overall nutrient content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages. |

---

## MyPlate Strategies for a Healthy Meal

There are many different strategies that you can use to align the **MyPlate** recommendations with the **Dietary Guidelines**. Aim to:

- Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables.
- Choose whole grains for at least half your grain intake.
- Include a variety of protein foods.
- Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy.
- Limit added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats.

<h1>Strategy: Dietary Guideline Eating Patterns</h1>

<p>The first dietary guideline is to follow a healthy eating pattern over the life span. As you may recall, a healthy eating pattern is based on types and amounts of foods and is designed to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits. The patterns recommend the amount of food to consume from each food group either each day or weekly. Because calorie needs vary based on age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity, the USDA created patterns for 12 different calorie levels. </p>

<img width="328" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe945bc1-a801-43d3-8fd5-f379a8bdf1c8" />

<p>"US Dietary Guidelines" by USDA is in the Public Domain</p>

<p>Review the sample eating pattern for an individual who needs to eat 2,000 calories per day to maintain a certain body weight. </p>

<p>Did you notice that the pattern promotes specific portions of a variety of foods within each food group to meet the calorie needs? The pattern includes a recommended amount of oils and limited calories from low-nutrient foods like added sugars.</p>

<h1>Strategy: Promote Healthy Snacking</h1>

<p>Snacks can be an important part of your diet. They can also help children get the nutrients needed to grow. Snacks can provide energy in the middle of the day or when you exercise. A healthy snack between meals can also decrease your hunger and keep you from overeating at mealtime.</p>

   <p>What makes a healthy snack Review the following suggestions for healthy snacks.</p>

 <ul>
   
  > <li>* Snacks are a part of your overall eating plan and therefore should have nutritional value.</li>
  
  > <li>* Include two or more food groups, especially for children.</li>
  
  > <li>* Aim for fruits, vegetables, whole-grain snacks, and low-fat dairy.</li>
  
  > <li>* Pick foods that are low in added fat and sugar and high in fiber and water. This means an apple is a healthier snack than a bag of chips.</li>
  
  > <li>* Watch the portion size. Help younger children get just enough to satisfy their hunger.</li>
 
  > <li>* Limit foods and drinks that contain added sugar.</li>
 
  > <li>* Choose fresh fruit instead of a fruit-flavored drink.</li>
  
  > <li>* Pair a protein and a carbohydrate to keep you fuller for longer. Examples include having an apple with string cheese or yogurt.</li>

</ul>

> <h3>Smart Snacks in Schools</h3>

>TIP:
><p>As of the 2014–2015 school year, all competitive foods and beverages sold during the school day must meet or exceed Smart Snacks in Schools nutrition standards, which include limits on fat, sugar, sodium, and calorie content. To meet the standards, schools must offer healthier competitive foods for their snacks and à la carte foods and beverages.</p>

<h3>Strategy: Read Nutrition Facts Labels</h3>

<p>People look at food labels for different reasons. One of the most important reasons is to help make quick, informed food choices that contribute to a healthy diet. The information in the main section of the food label contains product-specific information (serving size, calories, and nutrient information) and, therefore, can vary with each food product. All of the nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts Label is based on one serving of the food. </p>

<h1>Module 8</h1>

> <h1>BOOKMARK(pg)[47]</h1>

<p>According to international Food information Council, 36% of Americans follow a specific diet. Many individuals mkae modifications to the recommended dietary guideline to achieve a health goal such as weight loss, to omit foods that cause a negative reaction in teh body, to avoid foods that are not aligned to their religious or ethical b eliefs , or simply to adhere to food preferences. After engaging in this module, you should be able to describe diffrent types of modified diets.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

> <h3>Describe components of common modified diets.</h3>

<p>When you here the word "diet", what comes to mind? About 20 years ago, the word typically referred to a weight loss or therapeutic diet, such as the diabetic diet. However, the meaning expanded to incorporate any type of meal plan that is modified either to meet an indiviual's lifestyle, food preferenced, religious restrictions, or for ethical reasons, in this lesson, you will learn about common modified diets such as vegetarian, low-flat, low-calorie, high-protein, diabetic, and gluten-free diets.</p>

<h1>Vegetarian Diet</h1>
<p>According to a recent nationwide poll, approximately 5% of American adults are vegetarian, and 3% are vegan However, with the popularity of plant-based diets and the avalibility of plant based alternative foods, this number may rise in the coming years. People choose a vegetarian diet for many reasons, including compassion toward animals, enviornmental protection, and risk reduction and management of chronic diseases.</p>

<h3>Spectrum of Vegetarian Diets</h3>
<p>There is a spectrum of vegetarianism. Some individuals refrain from all animals and their products while other will eat eggs, milk, and milk products. Review the following types and descriptions of vegtarian diets.</p>

| Type of Vegetarianism | Foods Restricted or Included |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Vegetarian**        | Restricts flesh foods such as meat (e.g., beef, pork), poultry, wild game, seafood, and fish but may eat their products (e.g., milk, butter, and eggs). |
| **Lacto-ovo vegetarian** | Restricts all flesh foods; eats eggs and dairy products (Lacto and ovo are from the Latin words for milk and egg). |
| **Lacto-vegetarian**  | Restricts all flesh foods; drinks milk and eats milk products. |
| **Ovo-vegetarian**    | Restricts all flesh foods; eats eggs. |
| **Vegan**             | Restricts all flesh foods and their products; may also restrict honey. |
| **Raw vegan**         | Eats vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and sprouted grains; uncooked food consumption varies from 75% to 100%. |

> <h1>Vegan B-12 Requirement</h1>

>TIP:
> <p>Because B-12 is only found in animal prodcuts, vegans need reliable sources of vitamin B-12, such as fortified foods or supplements.</p>

<h3>Therapeutic Diets---High and Low</h3>
<p>A therapeutic diet is a meal plan that controls the intake of certain foods or nutrients to prevent, manage, or treat diseases and disorders. Some diets focus on specific macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—or calories. Other diets, such as the diabetic diet and celiac diet (gluten-free), focus on managing a specific disease.</p>

<h3>Macronutrient and Calorie Diets</h3>
<p>Low-fat, low-calorie, and high-protein diets are all examples of modified diets that focus on macronutrients or calories. Review the following table with a description of these diets.</p>

| Type of Diet       | Focus                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Comments                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low-fat**        | Focus on limiting the percentage of calories from fats. | A low-fat diet may also limit saturated fat and cholesterol in addition to total fat. A very low-fat diet is restricted to 15% of daily calories from fat.                                                  | May reduce the occurrence of conditions such as heart disease and obesity.                          |
| **Low-calorie**    | Focus on weight loss by restricting the total number of calories from all sources of macronutrients. | A low-calorie diet restricts the total number of calories consumed compared to the total number of calories needed. The goal is weight loss.                                                               | Promotes weight loss and reduces the occurrence of obesity; may also lower blood pressure.           |
| **High-protein**   | Focus on consuming more protein.                         | A high-protein diet requires a higher percentage of protein consumption compared to the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).                                                                          | Often used by athletes to increase muscle mass; may be unhealthy for some individuals.               |
| **Low-carbohydrate** | Focus on restricting calories and grams of carbohydrates. | There are many variations of this type of diet. A low-carbohydrate diet restricts the intake of carbohydrates (20–60 grams) per day and, therefore, requires a higher intake of fat and protein to obtain calories and nutrients. There is no calorie restriction in this diet. | May produce weight loss; may be unhealthy for some.                                                  |

<h3>Therapeutic Diets---Diebetic and Glueten-Free</h3>
<h4>Diabetic Diet</h4>
<p>In addition to exercise and medication, diabetes can be controlled and managed with a specific meal plan. The focus of a diabetic diet is to control blood glucose (sugar) levels. There are two methods of meal planning: using the MyPlate guidelines or counting carbohydrates. The MyPlate method helps you control your portion sizes. The carbohydrate counting method involves monitoring a specified number of grams of carbohydrates consumed each day.</p>

<p>Both methods control blood sugar levels by restricting foods and beverages with added sugars, limiting the amount of refined carbohydrate foods, and requiring that meals be eaten at regular intervals. Skipping meals causes a fluctuation in blood sugar levels, making it difficult to control. To control blood sugar, individuals on a diabetic diet need to plan the following:</p>

| Plan               | Recommendation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Meal Timing**    | **To maintain even blood sugars:**<br>- Avoid skipping meals.<br>- Eat smaller meals throughout the day. |
| **Portion Sizes**  | **To reduce portion sizes:**<br>- Make half the plate non-starchy vegetables and fruits.<br>- Watch the portion sizes of starchy vegetables and refined grains. |
| **Types of Foods** | **To reduce calorie intake:**<br>- Choose whole grains and high-fiber carbohydrates.<br>- Eat less fat and fatty meats.<br>- Avoid sugars and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages.<br>- Limit fruit juices; eat whole fruit instead. |


> <h3>Diabetes and Blood Sugars</h3>

> <h3>TIP:</h3>
><p>The focus of the diabetic diet is to control blood sugar levels. Some individuals will also need to restrict calories, sodium, and fats to manage other chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>

<h3>Celiac Diet (Gluten-Free)</h3>
<p>Gluten-free diets are popular right now; for most people, it is more of a food preference than a therapeutic diet. Gluten-free diets are essential for managing signs and symptoms of celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. Gluten—a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale (a wheat and rye mix)—cannot be digested by individuals with celiac disease, causes an allergic reaction in individuals with wheat allergies, and is not well tolerated with individuals who have gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>To follow a gluten-free diet, individuals must avoid consuming wheat, rye, barley, and products containing gluten—bread, pasta, and cereals. Instead, they should choose substitute grains such as whole oats, millet, and rice that provide nutrients for a healthy diet.</p>

<h3>Food Selectivity</h3>
<p>Food selectivity, although not technically a modified diet, is a type of restricted diet. Some children (and adults) are labeled "picky eaters" because they refuse to try or eat a variety of foods. Although many young children are picky eaters, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder have reported that their children have difficulty with food textures, smells, and tastes. Thus, they may have a very restricted selection of acceptable foods.</p>

<p>Why is this a problem? Picky eating, also referred to as food selectivity, is a significant problem because it may be associated with inadequate nutrition as a result of the restricted diet. It may also cause problems in a social setting and be a stressor in classroom and home settings.</p>

<h3>Religious or Ethical Restrictions</h3>
<p>Dietary considerations for individuals can also be influenced by beliefs. As mentioned above, some people avoid eating meat due to ethical beliefs about the treatment of animals or the environment. Religious beliefs can also influence food choice. For example, some Hindus avoid consuming eggs, fish, meat, and poultry. In some groups in Judaism, certain foods are restricted as well as food preparation methods.</p>

| Description | Correct Modified Diet |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Sara avoids eating wheat, rye, barley, and any products containing these grains. | **Gluten-free diet** |
| Jack eats six small portion-controlled meals. If he skips a meal, he feels light-headed and tired. He also limits refined-carbohydrate foods like pasta and bread and avoids foods and beverages with added sugars. | **Diabetic diet** |
| Maya eats a variety of foods from all of the food groups but in limited portions to help her lose weight. | **Low-calorie diet** |
| Kamal does not eat any beef, pork, poultry, wild game, seafood, fish, dairy products, or eggs. He also does not eat honey because it comes from an animal. | **Vegan** |
| Oliver limits the percentage of calories from fats, including saturated and unsaturated fats. | **Low-fat diet** |
| Eva enjoys a diet that focuses on eating more protein. | **High-protein diet** |
| Lucas does not eat gelatin, okra, mushrooms, jellies, or any type of food that is "slimy." | **Food selectivity** |

## Lesson Summary

Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to describe components of common modified diets. Take a moment to think about what you have learned:

- **Vegetarian**: Restricts flesh foods such as meat, poultry, wild game, seafood, and fish. Some more restricted vegetarians will also exclude dairy products and eggs.  
- **Low-fat diet**: Limits total calories from all fats. Individuals may also limit saturated fat and cholesterol.  
- **Low-calorie diet**: Focuses on a deficit of calories compared to the individual's daily calorie needs to maintain body weight.  
- **High-protein diet**: Focuses on consuming more protein compared to what is recommended by the RDA.  
- **Low-carbohydrate diet**: Restricts the calories and grams of carbohydrates consumed.  
- **Diabetic diet**: Controls blood sugar levels by limiting the intake of foods and beverages with added sugars. Individuals plan portion-sized meals and should not skip meals.  
- **Gluten-free diet**: Avoids wheat, rye, barley, and products containing gluten. Used by individuals with celiac disease or wheat allergies.  
- **Food selectivity**: A restrictive eating pattern typically based on the food's textures, smells, and tastes.  

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe common food allergies and intolerances and their effects on the body.</h3>
<p>One in five children and 32 million Americans have food allergies, and the numbers keep rising. Lactose intolerance, the most common specific food intolerance, affects about 10% of Americans. These individuals need to follow a special diet because their bodies negatively react to the food or nutrient. What is the difference between a food allergy and a food intolerance, and why do you need to know it? In this lesson, you will learn about common food allergies, food intolerances, and their symptoms.</p>

<h1>Food Allergies</h1>
<p>A food allergy occurs when the immune system overreacts to foods or beverages that contain a specific food protein. This food is harmless to most people, but to someone who is allergic to the food, it can be life-threatening. According to FoodAllergy.org, "Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That's one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom. About 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food."</p>

<h3>Common Food Allergies</h3>
<p>In the U.S., there are eight foods that cause most food allergy reactions. Review the common food allergies in children and adults.</p>

| Common Food Allergies in Children | Common Food Allergies in Adults |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Eggs                              | Fish                             |
| Milk                              | Peanuts                          |
| Peanuts                           | Shellfish                        |
| Soy                               | Tree nuts                        |
| Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc.) |                                  |
| Wheat                             |                                  |

>Peanut Allergy

>TIP:
><p>The peanut allergy is one of the most common allergies in children. Peanuts are a type of legume and grow underground. They are not the same as tree nuts, which grow on trees. Fortunately, 25% of children will outgrow a peanut allergy. Being allergic to peanuts does not increase the chance of being allergic to tree nuts or another type of legume.</p>

<h3>Food Allergy Reactions and Prevention</h3>
<p>Food allergy reactions always involve the immune system. They can also involve the skin, digestive system, respiratory system, and (in the most serious cases) the cardiovascular system. Symptoms can range from mild (e.g., rashes, hives, itching, swelling) to severe (e.g., trouble breathing, wheezing, loss of consciousness, anaphylaxis ). Life-threatening reactions can occur within minutes and require urgent medical attention. </p>

<h4>Review the following symptoms of food allergies:</h4>

| Non-Life-Threatening Symptoms | Life-Threatening Symptoms (Anaphylaxis) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Itching in and around mouth    | Difficult or noisy breathing; wheezing  |
| Hives or eczema                | Swelling of the tongue                  |
| Nasal congestion, runny nose   | Tightness in throat; difficulty talking |
| Gastrointestinal pains*        | Persistent cough; dizziness or collapse |
|                                | Becoming pale and floppy (in young children) |

*This is not always present.

<h3>Preventing a Food Allergy Reaction</h3>
<p>ood allergy reactions can be alarming. The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is by avoiding the food. Use the following strategies to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the ingredient section of food labels.</li>
  <li>Always ask questions when eating food you have not prepared yourself. </li>
  <li>If you have medication, take it with you wherever you go.</li>
  <li>In the classroom, make sure you know which students have allergies and what types of allergies they are.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Food Intolerance</h1>
<p>Food intolerance, commonly referred to as food sensitivity, is different than food allergies. The differences are based on the body system that triggers the reaction, the severity of the response, and the symptoms. When you have a food allergy, your immune system causes a reaction such as itching, swelling, redness, and pain. If you have a food sensitivity or intolerance, the reaction is started by a chemical reaction, not the immune system. Typically the symptoms are related to the digestive system.</p>
<h3>Causes and Examples of Food Intolerances</h3>
<p>Food sensitivities and intolerances are more common than food allergies. Review the following table of common causes, types of intolerances, and the rationale for why they occur.</p>

| Type of Intolerance      | Example                          | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Lack of enzyme**       | Lactose (milk and milk product) intolerance | The body does not have the right enzymes needed to digest a certain food. For example, the body does not have lactase enzyme to break down lactose sugar. |
| **Additives and preservatives** | Sulfites in wine                 | The body reacts to food additives or preservatives that are not naturally found in a product. |
| **Pharmacological**      | Caffeine (coffee)                | The body is sensitive to naturally found chemicals, such as caffeine or salicylates. This may be genetic. |
| **Sensitivity to macronutrient** | Foods with fermentable sugars (onions, broccoli, or brussels sprouts) | The body is not able to digest these short-chain (simple) fermentable carbohydrates. |

<h3>Food Intolerance Reactions</h3>
<p>The symptoms for a mild to moderate food allergy or intolerance may sometimes be similar, but most of the reactions to food intolerance develop in the digestive system. Food intolerance reactions, unlike a food allergy, are usually related to the amount of the food consumed. While symptoms caused by food intolerance can be immediate, they may take 12 to 24 hours to develop. Symptoms include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gas</li>
  <li>bloating</li>
  <li>diarrhea</li>
  <li>stomach pain or cramping</li>
  <li>constipation</li>
  <li>nausea</li>
</ul>

>Food Allergy versus Food intolerance

>TIP:
>Unlike food allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. A food intolerance is a chemical reaction to a particular food, drink, or nutrient.

## Lesson Activity – Food Allergy vs. Food Intolerance

## Lesson Summary

Now that you have completed this lesson, you should be able to describe common food allergies and intolerances and their effects on the body:

- **Food allergies** occur when the immune system overreacts to a food or beverage that contains a specific protein.  
  - **Common food allergens**: peanuts, eggs, soy, shellfish, tree nuts.  
  - **Symptoms**: can be mild or life-threatening; may include difficulty breathing, difficulty talking, itching, swelling, redness, diarrhea, and loss of consciousness.

- **Food intolerance** is caused by a chemical reaction to a specific type of food; it is **not** an immune reaction.  
  - **Common food intolerances**: milk and milk products, foods or beverages with sulfites or caffeine, vegetables with non-fermentable simple carbohydrates.  
  - **Symptoms**: bloating, cramping, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation.

<h3>Take a moment to think about what you have learned in this module:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals modify their diets to achieve a health goal, to manage a disease, or to avoid a negative reaction to foods. They may also choose these diets for ethical or religious reasons or because of their food preferences. </li>
  <li>Types of modified diets include the vegetarian, low-fat, low-calorie, high-protein, low-carbohydrate, gluten-free, diabetic, food allergy restricted, and food intolerance diets.</li>
</ul>

## Lesson Activity – Modified Diets

| Question | Scenario | Correct Answer | Explanation |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Q1** | Carl avoids eating milk and yogurt because it causes stomach pain and bloating. | **Food intolerance** | Carl has lactose intolerance, meaning he lacks the enzyme needed to break down lactose sugar in dairy products. |
| **Q2** | Mia is an athlete who is trying to increase her muscle mass. She eats more protein at lunch and dinner and drinks protein shakes for snacks. | **High-protein diet** | A high-protein diet focuses on consuming more protein than the RDA to support muscle growth. |
| **Q3** | Lucas has celiac disease and needs to avoid wheat, rye, and barley. | **Gluten-free diet** | A gluten-free diet eliminates wheat, rye, barley, and foods made from them to manage celiac disease. |

<h1>MODULE 9</h1>

<p>According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), more than 70.2% of adults are overweight or have obesity, and 1 in 6 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 are obese. Do these statistics surprise you? They should! These numbers continue to rise. The good news is that there are solutions to stop this upward trend. After engaging in this module, you should be able to describe the benefits of and the strategies for maintaining a healthy body weight.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe the benefits of maintaining a healthy body weight and the use of BMI to assess it.</h3>

<h1>Benefits of Healthy Body Weight</h1>
<p>Maintaining a healthy body weight is good for your physical, social, and emotional health. A healthy body weight reduces the risk of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cardiovascular disease and diabetes</li>
  <li>some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver)</li>
  <li>infertility</li>
  <li>sleep apnea</li>
  <li>asthma</li>
  <li>arthritis and gallstones</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assessing a Healthy Body Weight—BMI</h1>

<p>Using the scale alone is not a good indicator of a healthy weight because it doesn't account for an individual's height. One model that can help give a more complete view of health is BMI (body mass index). Adult BMI opens a new window is used as a screening tool to evaluate whether an individual is overweight or obese. BMI is calculated the same way for both adults and children: weight x 703 ÷ height2. If an individual's weight is higher than what is considered a healthy weight for a given height, it is described as overweight or obese. 

Use this Adult BMI calculator opens a new window to determine your BMI. To manually calculate your BMI, use this formula: weight (lb) x 703 ÷ height (in)</p>

<h3>BMI and Body Fatness</h3>
<p>It is important to note that BMI does not measure body fat directly, but the correlation between BMI and body fatness is strong. BMI seems to be more accurate as an indicator of body fatness with higher levels of BMI. In addition, two people can have the same BMI, but their level of body fatness may differ. For example, an athlete may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.</p>
<p>BMI is one way to model healthy weight, but it does not include all factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Additional information and evaluation by a health professional can provide a more complete picture of a healthy weight for an individual.</p>

<h1>BMI Interpretation</h1>
<h4>Adults</h4>
<p>For adults 20 years old and older, BMI is interpreted using standard weight status categories. These categories are the same for men and women of all body types and ages. The standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults are shown in the following table</p>

| BMI Range    | Weight Status   |
|--------------|-----------------|
| < 18.5       | Underweight     |
| 18.5 – 24.9  | Healthy weight  |
| 25.0 – 29.9  | Overweight      |
| > 30.0       | Obese           |


<h3>Children and Adolescents</h3>
<p>MI is interpreted differently for children and teens than for adults. The health professional will calculate the BMI using the same formula as the adult. Then the BMI is plotted on the BMI-for-age percentile growth charts. This extra step is necessary because weight and height change during growth and development, as does the relation to body fatness. A child's BMI must be interpreted relative to other children of the same sex and age.</p>

| Percentile Range | Weight Status   |
|------------------|-----------------|
| < 5%             | Underweight     |
| 5% – 85%         | Healthy weight  |
| 85% – 95%        | Overweight      |
| > 95%            | Obese           |


<p>For children and teens, BMI is only used to screen for potential weight- and health-related issues. It is not a diagnostic tool. For example, a child may have a high BMI for his or her age and sex, but to determine if excess fat is a problem, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments.

Use this Children and Teen BMI calculator opens a new window to determine the BMI of a child or adolescent.2</p>

> <h1>Children's and Teens' BMI</h1>

>TIP:
> <p>The BMI formula is the same as it is for adults, but the classification of weight status is based on BMI-for-age percentiles. You do not need to memorize the classifications; just know how the BMI is calculated and interpreted.</p>

## Lesson Summary

- Maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risks of chronic diseases and conditions, and positively impacts social and emotional health.  
- Total body weight consists of lean body mass (water, bone, muscle, organs) and fat mass. Excess fat increases risk for chronic diseases.  
- BMI is a screening tool used to evaluate a person's weight status; it **does not** measure body fat. Categories include underweight, normal (healthy) weight, overweight, and obese.  
- BMI calculation is the same for adults and children:  
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (lbs)} \times 703}{\text{height (in)}^2}
  \]
- Adults with BMI ≥ 25 are considered overweight or obese.  
- For children and teens, BMI is interpreted using BMI-for-age percentiles rather than direct BMI ranges.

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<h3>Describe healthy weight management strategies.</h3>

<p>Have you ever been on a weight-loss diet? If so, you know how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off. There are many factors that make it difficult to maintain a healthy body weight, including genes, eating habits, physical activity, screen time (e.g., TV, computer, phone), sleep habits, medical conditions or medications, and access to healthy foods and safe places to be active. In this lesson, you will learn about what calorie (energy) balance is, how to estimate daily calorie needs, and which strategies you can implement to maintain a healthy body weight.</p>

<h1>Energy (Calorie) Balance</h1>
<p>When it comes to maintaining a healthy weight for a lifetime, the bottom line is that calories count. Weight management is all about balance—balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses, or "burns." As you know, a calorie is defined as a unit of energy supplied by food. A calorie is a calorie regardless of its source. Whether you're eating carbohydrates, fats, sugars, or proteins, they all contain calories.</p>

<h3>Caloric Balance</h3>
<p>Caloric balance is like a scale. To remain in balance and maintain your body weight, the calories consumed from food must be balanced by the calories used through normal body functions, daily activities, and exercise.</p>

| If You Are…          | Your Caloric Balance Is… | How It Works                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maintaining your weight | In balance              | You are eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using. Your weight will remain stable. |
| Gaining weight         | In caloric excess       | You are eating more calories than your body is using. Your body stores these extra calories as fat, leading to weight gain. |
| Losing weight          | In caloric deficit      | You are eating fewer calories than you are using. Your body pulls from fat stores for energy, causing weight loss. |

<h3>Calories to Maintain Weight: Adults</h3>
<p>The number of calories an individual needs each day depends on the individual's age, gender, weight, height, and amount and type of exercise. Typically, adult women need 1,600–2,400 calories per day, and adult men need 2,000–3,000 calories per day. Inactive adults are at the lower calorie range. Calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age.</p>

<h3>Calories for Growth and Development: Children and Adolescents</h3>
<p>The estimated number of calories for children ranges from 1,000–2,000 calories per day for younger children up to 1,400–3,200 calories per day for adolescents. Boys generally have higher calorie needs than girls. </p>

<h3>Calories to Lose Weight</h3>
<p>To lose one pound of body fat, you would need to take in approximately 3,500 calories below your calorie needs. To lose about one to two pounds in a week, you will need a calorie deficit of 500–1000 calories per day. This can be achieved by eating fewer calories, being more physically active, or both. For example, to lose one pound in a week, eat 250 fewer calories and burn 250 calories through exercise each day. Use the online MyPlate Plan Calculator opens a new window to determine your daily calorie needs.</p>

<h1>Weight Management Strategies</h1>
<p>When it comes to weight loss, there are many fad diets promising fast results. But such diets can limit your nutritional intake, can be unhealthy, and tend to fail in the long run. The key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight isn't about short-term dietary changes. It's about a lifestyle choice that includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, and balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When losing weight, more physical activity increases the number of calories your body burns for energy. </li>
  <li>The burning of calories through physical activity, combined with reducing the number of calories you eat, creates a "calorie deficit" that results in weight loss.</li>
  <li>Evidence shows the only way to maintain weight loss is to be engaged in regular physical activity.</li>
  <li>Physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes beyond that produced by weight reduction alone.</li>

<h1>Weight Management Strategy: Healthy Eating</h1>
<h3>Strategy: It's All About Balance</h3>
<p>Do you have to give up your favorite comfort food? No! Healthy eating is all about balance. You can enjoy your favorite foods even if they are high in calories, fat, or added sugars. Some general tips for high-fat and high-calorie foods include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eat comfort foods less often. </li>
  <li>eat smaller amounts. </li>
  <li>try a lower-calorie version. </li>
  <li>add more non-starchy vegetables.</li>
  <li>avoid added fats.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy: Rethink Your Drink</h3>
<p>Many people don't realize just how many calories beverages can contribute to their daily calorie intake. The good news is that you have plenty of options for reducing the number of calories in what you drink.</p>

| Higher Calorie Beverage                 | Lower Calorie Alternative             |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Medium whole milk café latte (265 calories) | Medium non-fat milk café latte (125 calories) |
| Regular soft drink: 20 ounce (227 calories)  | Seltzer or diet soft drink (0 calories)        |
| Sweetened iced tea: 16 ounce (180 calories)  | Sparkling water with lemon (0 calories)        |

<h1>Strategy: Watch Out for Added Sugar</h1>
<p>Sweeteners that add calories go by many different names. Some common caloric sweeteners are listed below. If these appear in the ingredients list of your favorite beverage or food, you know the food or drink has been sweetened with sugar.</p>

<ul>
  <li>high-fructose corn syrup; corn syrup</li>
  <li>fructose</li>
  <li>fruit juice concentrates</li>
  <li>sugar</li>
  <li>sucrose (table sugar)</li>
  <li>dextrose </li>
  <li>malt</li>
</ul>

> <h3>How to Spot a Sugar</h3>

> <h3>TIP:</h3>
> <p>When reading food labels, look for ingredients ending in -ose, such as dextrose or fructose, because they are a sugar or form of carbohydrate.</p>

<h1>Weight Management Strategy: Portion Control</h1>
<p>Research shows that people unintentionally consume more calories when faced with larger portions. This can mean significant excess calorie intake, especially when eating high-calorie foods. Here are some tips to help you avoid some common portion-size pitfalls.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eating out: Split an entrée with a friend, or ask for a to-go box and wrap up half your meal when it is brought to the tab</li>
  <li>Eating in: Serve the food on individual small plates instead of putting the serving dishes on the table.</li>
  <li>Eating in front of the TV: Try to avoid eating while watching TV. If you really need to eat in front of the TV, put the amount that you plan to eat into a small bowl or container instead of eating straight from the package. </li>
  <li>Snack: If you feel hungry between meals, eat a healthy snack, like a piece of fruit or small salad, to avoid overeating during your next meal.2</li>
</ul>

<h1>MODULE 10 (PG)[57]</h1>

<p>Nearly 100,000 schools and institutions serve school lunches to 29.8 million students each day. Students who participate in school breakfast programs have higher standardized test scores and lower levels of absenteeism. Over 30% of deaths from foodborne illness occur in children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The United States government supports the health of children with federally funded school food nutrition programs, training, and nutrition resources. It also establishes food safety guidelines to prevent foodborne illnesses. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify school food programs and basic principles of food safety.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h3>Describe the national school food and wellness programs and their benefits.</h3>

<p>School food programs are critical to student health and well-being, especially for low-income students. They ensure that students have the nutrition they need throughout the day to learn. Research shows that receiving free or reduced-price school lunches reduces food insecurity, obesity rates, and poor health. In this lesson, you will learn about the national school food programs and other government programs that promote the health of children through healthy nutrition practices.</p>

<h3>School Breakfast and Lunch Programs</h3>

<p>The School Breakfast Program
Founded in 1966, the School Breakfast Program (SBP) provides nutritious breakfast meals to students at participating schools. There are three kinds of meals students may be eligible for: free meals, reduced-price breakfast, and full-price (paid) meals based upon the family's income.</p>

<h3>Is the Program Effective? </h3>

<p>Over 91,000 schools and 15 million students are participating in the SBP as of 20201. This includes full-, reduced- and free-priced meals. Research demonstrates that the SBP increases both nutrition for students and cognitive achievement while reducing food insecurity 2. It is possible that improved nutrition provides some of the micronutrients critical for brain development and the neurological processes of learning. </p>

<h3>The School Lunch Program</h3>

<p>The National School Lunch Program (NSLP), like the SBP, is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential childcare institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost, no-cost and full-priced lunches to children each school day. The program serves approximately 30 million children each year as of 2022</p>

<h3>What about Snacks? </h3>
<p>School food authorities can also be reimbursed for snacks served to children who participate in an approved educational afterschool program.</p>

<h3>How Do the Programs Work?</h3>

<p>he programs are generally operated by public or nonprofit private schools of high school grade or below. Participating school districts and independent schools receive cash subsidies and USDA foods for each reimbursable meal they serve. In exchange, NSLP institutions must serve lunches that meet federal meal pattern requirements and offer the lunches and breakfasts at a free or reduced price to eligible children.</p>

<h3>Are the Meals Nutritious?</h3>

<p>Schools participating in the NSLP and SBP require participating schools to offer nutritious meals meeting the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. The meal patterns are based on the MyPlate food groups—fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and fluid milk—in portions appropriate for the child's age. In adherence to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the meals limit sodium and saturated fats and do not allow any foods with trans fat or minimal nutritional value</p>

<h3>Team Nutrition</h3>

<p>Team Nutrition, an initiative of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, supports the NSLP and SBP by providing nutrition training and educational resources to schools, childcare settings, and summer meal sites that participate in these programs.</p>

<h3>What Resources Are Available? </h3>

<p>Team Nutrition helps communicate messages using MyPlate to prompt students to build a healthy plate at mealtime. The program offers a variety of resources, including lesson plans, hands-on activities, videos, and graphics that teachers can use if their schools participate in the NSLP. View the Team Nutrition Resource Catalog opens a new window.</p>

<h1>School Wellness Programs</h1>

<p>Schools play an important role in promoting the health and safety of children and adolescents by helping them establish lifelong health patterns. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Healthy Schools works with states, school systems, communities, and national partners to prevent chronic diseases and promote the health and well-being of children and adolescents in schools. </p>

<p>A major initiative of CDC Healthy Schools is to work with school districts to develop a local school wellness program and accompanying policies. The policies must address the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategies for nutrition promotion and education, physical activity, and other school-based activities that promote student wellness</li>
  <li>Nutrition guidelines for all foods sold on each school campus during the school day </li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
> Identify common food safety techniques at home and at school.

<p>Did you know that 1 in 6 Americans get sick from food poisoning each year? Nearly 125,000 young children under the age of five die from foodborne diseases every year. Just one tiny bacterium can grow to over 2,097,152 bacteria in seven hours when kept at room temperature. How can you prevent getting ill from contaminated food? It's easy! In this lesson, you will learn about the four steps to prevent foodborne illness: clean, separate, cook, and chill.</p>

**Which three cleaning strategies should Lora tell her students to use?**

- Use antimicrobial soap and cold water.
- Wash your hands after blowing your nose.
- Wash an apple before eating it.
- Wash your hands before and after handling food.

**Correct Answer:**  
Wash hands with **warm, soapy water** for 20 seconds before and after handling food and after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or handling pets. Wash fruits and produce (but **not** meat or animal products) before eating. Antibacterial soap does **not** remove bacteria any better than plain soap.

---

**Which two strategies should be used to prevent cross-contamination?**

- Place produce on top of raw meat in the refrigerator.
- Cook chicken and vegetables separately.
- Use different cutting boards when cutting chicken and vegetables.
- Wash the knife before using it to cut vegetables.

**Correct Answer:**  
When handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs, keep these foods and their juices away from ready-to-eat foods. Clean cutting boards and knives after cutting animal products. Chicken and vegetables **can** be cooked together as long as the chicken is cooked to the required temperature.

---

## 3. Strategies to Kill Bacteria During Cooking

**Which three strategies should be used to kill bacteria during cooking?**

- Reheat foods if left out for three or more hours.
- Keep food hot after cooking.
- Microwave food thoroughly.
- Use a thermometer to check the internal temperature.

**Correct Answer:**  
Food is safely cooked when the internal temperature is high enough to kill germs that can make you sick. Use a thermometer and cooking temperature charts to ensure the internal temperature is reached. Keep food hot after cooking, and microwave food thoroughly. Do **not** reheat food left out too long.

---

## 4. What to Do with a Sandwich Left Out for Five Hours

**Sophia is attending a meeting tonight after work. She brought a ham and cheese sandwich from home for dinner. She accidentally left the sandwich on her desk for five hours. What should she do with the sandwich?**

- Heat it in a microwave.
- Throw it out.
- Ask the cafeteria staff to put it in the quick-chill refrigerator.
- Put it in the refrigerator and eat it for dinner.

**Correct Answer:**  
Because bacteria grow rapidly at room temperature, perishable food like cold-cut meats and cheese should be **thrown out** if left at room temperature for more than two hours. Reheating the sandwich may not kill all the bacteria. Putting the sandwich into the refrigerator will only stop bacterial growth; it will not kill bacteria already present.

## Lesson Summary

<p>How you feel can affect your relationships, your ability to carry out everyday activities, and your overall mental health. How you react to your experiences and feelings can change over time. Emotional wellness is the ability to successfully handle life's stresses and adapt to change and difficult times. At the end of this unit, you should be able to identify factors that influence mental, emotional, and social wellness.</p>

<p>1 in 5 of the people you know may experience mental illness at some point in their lives. Disorders vary in impact, ranging from no impairment to mild, moderate, and even severe impairment. Although millions of Americans are affected by mental health conditions every year, only half receive treatment. Knowing the warning signs of common mental health disorders, and who the available mental health professionals are, may be the key to helping an individual get the necessary treatment. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify the characteristics of mental health and common mental disorders.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
> Identify characteristics of positive mental health, the warning signs of suicide, and the types of mental health specialists.

<p>Do you know people who always seem sad or gloomy? While everyone has a bad day or suffers from difficult times, when sadness seems never-ending, it's time to pay attention. In this lesson, you will review the components of mental health, both of wellness and illness, and how mental health and wellness can impact your life.</p>

Suicide is complicated and tragic, but it is often preventable. </p>

<h3>What Is Suicide? </h3>
<p>Suicide  is defined as the act of ending one's life through direct violence at oneself. A suicide attempt is defined as an attempt by a person to end their own life that does not result in death.</p>

<h1>Mood Disorders: Depression</h1>
<p>Depression is a term that is often used in incorrect contexts. For example, someone might say they are depressed because they got a bad grade on a test despite studying for hours or because a relationship ended. While the sadness is real, it usually decreases with time. With depression, the sadness is constant. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.</p>

<h3>Depression Warning Signs</h3>

<h1>Eating Disorders: Anorexia</h1>
<p>Eating disorders are serious behavioral problems. They can involve severe overeating or not consuming enough food to stay healthy. They also involve extreme concerns about body shape or weight. Types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder.2 Eating disorders are most common in adolescent females and in athletes in weight-related sports, such as wrestling, cheerleading, and gymnastics.  </p>

<h3>Anorexia</h3>
<p>Everyone needs food to survive. But for some, the simple act of eating produces extreme anxiety and irrational behaviors. Sometimes, these behaviors lead to anorexia. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that makes people lose more weight than is considered healthy for their age and height. Individuals with this disorder have an intense irrational fear of weight gain or "getting fat," even when they are underweight. They may diet, exercise excessively, or use other methods to lose weight.</p>

<h3>Anorexia Warning Signs</h3>
<p>There is not one sole cause for anorexia; in factor, many factors can contribute to its development. Anorexia is most common in females and often begins during the teen years or early adulthood.</p>

<h1>Eating Disorders: Bulimia and Binge Eating</h1>

<h3>Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
<p>Another serious eating disorder is bulimia nervosa, which involves periods of excessive overeating (or binge eating) followed by extreme methods of purging (or getting rid of the food). People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, at a normal weight, or even overweight. Purging methods can include the following behaviors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forced vomiting</li>
  <li>excessive use of laxatives or diuretics</li>
  <li>fasting</li>
  <li>excessive exercise</li>
  <li>combination of any of these behaviors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Binge Eating Disorder</h3>
<p>Individuals who lose control over their eating- and do not engage in purging, excessive exercise, or fasting may be diagnosed with binge eating disorder. This is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. To be diagnosed with binge eating disorder, an individual must binge regularly—at least once a week for three months—and feel out of control while eating.</p>

<h1>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h1>
<p>Most people worry about day-to-day stressors in life, such as making money, finishing school, or caring for family. But for anyone who struggles with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the struggle can be overwhelming and endless. People with GAD may find it difficult to control their anxiety and stay focused on daily tasks.</p>

<h3>GAD Warning Signs</h3>
<p>Children often worry about their performance in school or sports, and adults often worry about job security, health, or finances. Although the causes of anxiety may differ, the warning signs of GAD are similar and include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feeling restless and having trouble relaxing</li>
  <li>having trouble concentrating</li>
  <li>being easily startled </li>
  <li>having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep</li>
  <li>having headaches, muscle aches, and stomach issues</li>
</ul>

<h1>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</h1>
<h3>Obsessive-compulsive disorder </h3>

<p>OCD) involves repeated, upsetting thoughts called obsessions. To manage or make these upsetting thoughts go away, the individual may repeat a specific behavior or set of behaviors called compulsions. Some compulsive behaviors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hand washing</li>
  <li>counting</li>
  <li>avoiding germs (germaphobia)</li>
  <li>checking on tasks repeatedly (e.g., turning off lights, locking doors)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>being unable to control thoughts or behaviors, even when recognized as excessive</li>
  <li>spending at least one hour per day focused on these thoughts and behaviors</li>
  <li>not experiencing pleasure when performing behaviors or rituals but rather feeling brief relief from the stress the thoughts cause</li>
  <li>experiencing significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors</li>
</ul>

<h1>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</h1>
<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) existed long before the general public became aware of it. ADHD is a brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (or both), which interferes with functioning or development. Inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity are the key behaviors of ADHD. Some people with ADHD only have problems with one of the behaviors, while others have both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.</p>

<h3>ADHD: Inattention</h3>
<p>Inattention is when a person wanders off task, lacks persistence, has difficulty sustaining focus, and is disorganized. These problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension. The following are symptoms of inattention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overlooking or missing details; making careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities</li>
  <li>having problems sustaining attention in tasks or play, including conversations, lectures, or lengthy readings</li>
  <li>not seeming to listen when spoken to directly or not following through on instructions</li>
  <li>having difficulties organizing tasks and activities</li>
  <li>avoiding or disliking tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as schoolwork or homework</li>
</ul>

<h3>ADHD: Hyperactivity</h3>

<p>Hyperactivity is when a person seems to move about constantly including in situations in which these behaviors are not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. In adults, it may present as extreme restlessness or wearing others out with constant activity. Most children have the combined type of ADHD. In preschool, the most common ADHD symptom is hyperactivity. It is normal to have some inattention, unfocused motor activity, and impulsivity. However, for people with ADHD, these behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how individuals function socially, at school, or in a job.</p>

<h3>ADHD: Impulsivity</h3>

<p>Impulsivity is when a person makes hasty actions, which may have a high potential for harm in the moment without first thinking about them. Impulsivity also involves a person desiring immediate rewards, stemming from an inability to delay gratification. The symptoms of impulsivity that people present include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fidgeting and squirming in their seats</li>
  <li>leaving their seats in situations when staying seated is expected, such as in the classroom or in the office</li>
  <li>running around or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate </li>
  <li>often feeling restless (in teens and adults)</li>
  <li>being unable to play or engage in hobbies quietly</li>
  <li>being constantly in motion or "on the go," or acting as if "driven by a motor"</li>
  <li>talking nonstop</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that not everyone who demonstrates these symptoms has ADHD. Other causes of these behaviors are anxiety, depression, or a learning disability. Therefore, it is so important to reach out for professional help to make the correct diagnosis.</p>

<h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to be a "developmental disorder" because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. Autism is known as a "spectrum" disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. ASD occurs in all ethnic, racial, and economic groups.</p>

<h3>ASD Symptoms and Signs</h3>
<p>People with ASD struggle with social communication and interaction, have restricted interests, and perform repetitive behaviors. The following table gives some examples of the types of behaviors that are seen in people diagnosed with ASD. Not all people with ASD will show all behaviors, but most will show several.</p>

## 🧩 Autism Spectrum Disorder: Areas of Difficulty & Example Behaviors

<h1>MODULE 12</h1>

<p>People have various types of relationships—including with family members, neighbors, friends, and romantic partners. Romantic relationships, in particular, are an important part of an individual's sexual health and can bring companionship and intimacy. In order to enjoy social and sexual well-being, however, each person must be able to communicate effectively and recognize when a relationship is healthy and when it is not (Healthy Relationships, 2019). After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify these essential characteristics of social and sexual health.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
> Identify the factors that influence social health, including relationships and communication
<p>Positive social health involves more than having friends and family. It is about having connections, a sense of belonging, a constant support system, and positive relationships. In this lesson, you will examine the factors that influence social health, including relationships and communication.</p>

<h1>Relationships</h1>
<h3>Healthy Versus Unhealthy Relationships</h3>
<p>Healthy relationships generate respect and honesty between the people involved. For example, each person listens to the other's thoughts and opinions, and the people accept each other's right to say "No" or to change their mind without giving each other a negative response. A healthy relationship encourages individuals to share their feelings without fear of judgment. People in healthy relationships might disagree or argue, but they should be able to solve their problems by communicating effectively.1 A relationship does not have to be abusive to be considered unhealthy. Unhealthy relationships are marked by issues such as disrespect and control.2</p>

<h1>Relationships in Childhood and Adolescence</h1>
<p>During adolescence, young people learn how to form safe and healthy relationships with friends, parents, teachers, and romantic partners. Adolescents explore different identities and roles during this time, and relationships contribute to their development. Peers, in particular, play a big role in identity formation, but relationships with caring adults—including parents, mentors, or coaches—are also important for adolescent development. Often, the parent-adolescent relationship is the one that informs how a young person handles other relationships. Unfortunately, adolescents sometimes develop unhealthy relationships and experience or exhibit bullying or dating violence.</p>

<h3>Bullying</h3>
<p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice, about 20% of students ages 12–18 experience bullying. Bullying is any unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. There are three types of bullying: verbal, social, and physical. Examples of bullying include making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose. Both children who are bullied and those who bully others may have serious, lasting problems.</p>

## Relationships Tips

### Relationships with Parents, Stepparents, Grandparents, and Guardians

- Make time to talk  
- Share feelings  
- Discuss tough, difficult topics  
- Talk openly about family rules  
- Choose which issues are worth arguing about  
- Spend quality time together  
- Try to manage emotions

- Get advice from parents  
- Establish individual spaces in the house  
- Respect each sibling's personal space  
- Pick your battles  
- Try to do fun things together  
- Focus on the positive  

<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>Communication is vital in creating and maintaining a relationship, whether it be an intimate relationship—such as with a partner, child, or friend—or a professional relationship—such as with a co-worker, supervisor, or client. Communication skills affect how people solve problems and resolve conflict, and they also affect the level of trust individuals generate in their relationships. A lack of communication may result in confusion or misunderstanding, as well as the development of poor communication patterns.</p>

<h3>Forms of Communication</h3>
<p>Communication skills are important to everyone; communication is how people give and receive information and convey their ideas and opinions with those around them. Communication can be face-to-face, in writing, or digital, and it comes in many forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verbal (sounds, language, and tone of voice) </li>
  <li>aural (listening and hearing) </li>
  <li>nonverbal (facial expressions, body language, and posture) </li>
  <li>written (journals, emails, blogs, and text messages) </li>
  <li>visual (signs, symbols, and pictures)7</li>
</ul>

## Effective Communication Skills

To achieve social health, it is important to develop a variety of skills for both communicating to others and interpreting the information received from others. Knowing the audience and understanding how they need to receive information are as important as knowing oneself. The following is a list of general communication tips:

- Create opportunities for two-way conversations. Encourage questions. Ask questions.  
- Consider the sender's or receiver's communication strengths and weaknesses, and communicate in the manner that is best accepted by the sender or receiver.  
- Paraphrase what you heard back to the speaker to ensure you have a mutual understanding.  
- Do not be distracted by words that affect you emotionally. Continue to listen, even when you feel the urge to start a debate.  
- Communicate to be understood. Many people communicate to impress, not express. Use short words that communicate clearly and concretely. Present one idea—or two, at most—in one sentence. Avoid jargon. Use strong verbs. Avoid passive voice as much as possible.  
- Be open to feedback. Be an active listener.

- Adolescents sometimes develop unhealthy relationships, experience or exhibit bullying, or experience dating violence. Bullying is any unwanted, aggressive, repeated behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance.  
- Healthy relationships between children, adolescents, and adults encourage sharing feelings, discussing difficult topics, managing emotions, giving individuals space within the home, and spending quality time together.  
- To achieve social health, it is important to develop a variety of communication skills, including active listening, using open-ended questions, being open to feedback, and communicating in the manner that is best accepted by the sender and receiver.

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

> Identify the factors that influence sexual health, including sex and gender, contraception, and harassment.

<p>What do you think when you hear the word "sex?" Is it about intercourse, gender, or something else? What do you think when you hear the phrase "sexual health?" In this lesson, you will examine the factors that influence sexual health and well-being. You will explore the terms sex, gender, gender identity, as well as sexual orientation, and the impact of sexual harassment on sexual health. You will also learn how the use of reversible methods of contraception can improve sexual health by reducing both the chance of unwanted pregnancies and the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI).</p>

<h3>Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation</h3>
> The terms "sex" and "gender" are not the same.

<p>A person's sex is determined by their biology and the physiological differences—such as breasts, penis, or clitoris—found among male, female, and various intersex bodies. </p>

<p>Gender refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male, female, or intersex. </p>

<h3>Sex: Male, Female, and the Spectrum of Sex </h3>

<p>Throughout time, biological sex has been divided into two categories: male and female. However, a small percentage of children are born intersex . This means that they cannot be distinctly identified as male or female due to variations in physical and genetic sex characteristics. For example, the individual may be born with female genitalia but has the male reproductive anatomy inside. It also refers to male and female individuals whose genetic makeup does not match their physical sex. Because of these variations, many now view sex as existing along a spectrum rather than two mutually exclusive categories.</p>

<h3>Gender: Gender, Gender Identity and Transgender</h3>

<p>A person's sex, as determined by their biology, does not always correspond with their gender; therefore, the terms "sex" and "gender" are not interchangeable. Babies born with male sex characteristics are labeled as "boys," and those with female sex characteristics are labeled as "girls." Many children who are born intersex are forcibly assigned as either a boy or a girl and may even be surgically "corrected" to fit a particular gender.</p>

<p>Gender identity is a person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender. Those who identify with a gender that is different from their biological sex are referred to as transgender.</p>

<h3>Sexuality and Sexual Orientation</h3>

<p><em>HBuman</em> sexuality refers to a person's sexual interest in and attraction to others, as well as their capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. A person's sexaul orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to particular sexes or genders. Review the terms and definitions associated with sexuality and sexual orientation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heterosexual: a person who is attracted to memebers of the "opposite" sex</li>
  <li>Lesbain: a homosexual women</li>
  <li>Gay: a homosexual person (typically reffering to a man)</li>
  <li>Bisexual: a person who is attracted to both men and women</li>
  <li>Transgender: a person whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth </li>
</ul>

## Definitions and Terms

| **Definition**                                                                 | **Term**              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| An individual who cannot be distinctly identified as male or female due to variations in sex characteristics | **Intersex**           |
| Social or cultural distinctions associated with being male, female, or intersex | **Gender**             |
| A person's sense of self as a member of a particular gender                    | **Gender identity**    |
| A person's emotional and sexual attraction to particular sexes or genders     | **Sexual orientation** |
| Individuals who identify with a gender that is different from their biological sex | **Transgender**    |

<h3>Sexual Harassment, Sexual Bias, and Sexual Assault</h3>
<h4>Sexual Harassment</h4>

<p>For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled" (Understanding Sexual Health, 2019). In addition, it is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. However, according to a survey conducted by National Public Radio, 81% of women have experienced (Chatterjee R., 2018). And, in 2018, 15.9% of the sexual harassment charges were filed by males (EEOC, 2018). The definition of sexual harassment is broad and includes any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature. It also includes offensive remarks about a person's sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general</p>

<h3>Sexting </h3>
<p>Sexual communication using technology such as smartphones and computers can also be used as a form of sexual harassment. The term sexting  refers to taking, sending, or forwarding sexually explicit photos, videos, or messages to or from a mobile phone. Although it may appear harmless or as a method of flirting, the images are permanent. Once sent, they cannot be removed. In addition to risking a person's reputation and friendships, people could be breaking the law if they create, forward, or even save this kind of message.</p>

<h3>Sexual Bias Versus Sexual Harassment</h3>
<p>Sexual bias is different than sexual harassment. It is discrimination of a particular group or individual based on their sexual orientation. Members of the LGBT community are at an increased risk for a number of health threats when compared to their heterosexual peers. Differences in sexual behavior account for some of these disparities, but others are associated with social and structural inequities, such as the stigma and discrimination that LGBT populations experience.</p>

<h3>Sexual Assault Versus Sexual Harassment</h3>
<p>Sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing. Sexual harassment includes any type of unwelcome sexual advance, whereas sexual assault  is intentional sexual contact characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority toward a victim who does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape, forcible sodomy, and other unwanted indecent contact (e.g., kissing against another person's will) that is aggravated, abusive, or wrongful. This includes unwanted and inappropriate sexual contact or attempts to commit any of these acts.</p>

<h3>Contraception</h3>
<p>Sexual and romantic relationships are an important part of life. Fear of an unplanned pregnancy and of STIs, however, can affect a person's sexual and emotional health. The use of contraceptives can improve sexual health by reducing the chance of unwanted pregnancies and of contracting an STI. Some birth control methods may be more effective for reducing unwanted pregnancies, whereas other methods may be more effective for reducing the transmission of STIs. </p>

<h3>
Reversible Methods of Birth Control</h3>
<p>Reversible methods for birth control refer to birth control methods that users can stop using and become pregnant. Generally, permanent methods, such as a vasectomy or tubal ligation. </p>

# Characteristics of Reversible Birth Control Methods

| **Method** | **Description** | **Type** | **User** | **Protection Against** | **Failure Rate** |
|------------|------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Fertility Awareness (Rhythm Method / Natural Family Planning) | Abstaining from intercourse during fertile days of the menstrual cycle | Natural | Male/Female | Unintended pregnancy only | 25% |
| IUD (Intrauterine Device) | A T-shaped device inserted into the uterus that releases hormones | Hormonal | Female | Unintended pregnancy only | Less than 1% |
| The Pill | Oral contraceptive taken daily to release hormones preventing ovulation | Hormonal | Female | Unintended pregnancy only | 7% |
| The Patch | Hormonal dermal patch worn on the skin, replaced weekly | Hormonal | Female | Unintended pregnancy only | 7% |
| Vaginal Ring | Soft silicone ring inserted monthly into the vagina to release hormones | Hormonal | Female | Unintended pregnancy only | 7% |
| Diaphragm | Cup-shaped device placed in the cervix with spermicide before sex | Barrier | Female | Unintended pregnancy only | 17% |
| Male Condom | Thin sheath worn over the penis during sex to block sperm | Barrier | Male | Unintended pregnancy and STDs | 15–18% |
| Female Condom | Thin pouch inserted into the vagina before sex to block sperm | Barrier | Female | Unintended pregnancy and STDs | 21% |

<h3>Review: Reversible Methods of Birth Control </h3>
> Take a moment to review the three types of reversible birth control methods.

<h3>Hormonal Contraceptives</h3>
<p>Hormonal contraceptive methods provide hormones to the woman that trick her body into thinking she is pregnant. Thus the egg is not released each month. It is important to note that hormonal methods do not protect against STIs. There are five different methods of delivering the hormones: pill, shot, patch, hormonal ring, and IUD.</p>

<h3>Barrier Method</h3>
<p>arrier methods of birth control work by preventing fertilization (the union of the sperm cell and the egg cell). The two main barrier methods are condoms (for males and females) and diaphragms (or cervical cap). Condoms can protect against STIs and pregnancy, but they have a higher failure rate due to user error. Diaphragms must be fitted by a health professional and will have a higher failure rate if the woman gains or loses weight after she is fitted.</p>

<h3>Fertility Awareness Method (FAM)</h3>
<p>Fertility awareness is a natural method of birth control that is based on understanding a woman's reproductive cycle. Couples use the FAM when they do not want to conceive a child. They abstain from intercourse during the fertile days of the month. Two common ways to track fertility are the "calendar" method and "basal body temperature" method.</p>

> Abstience

> TIP:
> Generally, the term "abstinence" refers to refraining from any vaginal, oral, and anal sex practice. It is the only 100% effective way to avoid pregnancy and STIs.

<h1>MODULE 13(PG)[75]</h1>

<p>Healthy individuals not only eat right and exercise but are also emotionally stable. How you feel can affect your ability to carry out everyday activities, your relationships, and your overall mental health. How you react to your experiences and feelings can change over time. Emotional wellness is the ability to successfully handle life's stresses and adapt to change and difficult times. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify the factors associated with maintaining emotional wellness.</p>

> Identify the components of emotional wellness.

<p>ave you ever been in a situation that made you feel anxious or stressed, but you kept calm and didn't overreact? The ability to recognize your feelings and cope with difficult situations is a sign of good emotional health. In this lesson, you will learn about the characteristics of emotional health, including self-esteem, self-confidence, and emotional intelligence.</p>

<h3Emotional Wellness></h3>

<p>Emotional wellness, also referred to as emotional health, is the ability to have and express thoughts, feelings, and emotions in an appropriate manner. Individuals who exhibit emotional wellness accept their feelings and cope effectively with life. Emotional wellness is closely tied to social health because it allows an individual to form supportive and social connections with others. Likewise, mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Emotional Wellness</h3>
<p>According to The Successful Grown-Up (2015), characteristics of emotionally healthy people include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connected—They engage positively with others and their environment.</li>
  <li>Goal oriented—They have goals and act to achieve the goals.</li>
  <li>Self-aware—They can identify their emotions and feelings and spend time reflecting on them.</li>
  <li>Flexible—They have the ability to change directions as situations arise while maintaining emotional stability.</li>
  <li>Self-caring—They are respectful of their body through healthy eating and regular exercise.</li>
  <li>Responsible—They are accountable for their actions and live up to their obligations</li>
  <li>Resilient—They can bounce back from loss or failure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self-Esteem and Self-Worth</h3>
<p>Individuals who are emotionally healthy accept themselves and their feelings. Their positive thoughts about emotions, including belief in their worth (self-esteem) and abilities (self-confidence), motivate them to engage in healthy behaviors and avoid unhealthy behaviors. </p>

# Characteristics of Self-Esteem and Self-Confidence

| **Characteristic** | **Description** | **Behaviors Exhibited** |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Self-esteem** | Self-esteem has to do with the value and respect individuals have for themselves. Simply put, it is their opinion of themselves. | - Feel good about themselves  <br> - Proud of what they can do but do not need to show off  <br> - Know there are some things that they are good at and some things they need to improve |
| **Self-confidence** | Self-confidence has to do with what people think about their skills and abilities, as well as the belief that they will be fine even in the face of obstacles. | - Feel it is okay whether they win or lose  <br> - Usually think, "I can do this," before doing something  <br> - Eager to learn new things  <br> - Able to handle criticism  <br> - Try to do things without help but don't mind asking for help if they need it |

<h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

<p>Individuals differ considerably in their emotional experience. Some can clearly distinguish among a variety of emotions while others treat all emotions interchangeably. The ability to monitor one's own and others' emotions, discriminate among them, and use the information gathered to guide one's thinking and actions is known as emotional intelligence (EI). It is a fairly specific ability that connects a person's knowledge processes to his or her emotional processes. </p>


<ul>
  <li>Being self-aware—Observing and recognizing a feeling as it happens</li>
  <li>Managing emotions—Handling feelings so they are appropriate; realizing what is behind a feeling; finding ways to handle fears and anxieties, anger, and sadness</li>
  <li>Motivating oneself—Channeling emotions in the service of a goal; emotional self-control; delaying gratification and stifling impulses</li>
  <li>Having empathy—Sensitivity to others' feelings and concerns and considering their perspective; appreciating the differences in how people feel about things</li>

<p>Many adults can recall what they were doing and where they were on September 11, 2001, when they heard about the terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon. A crisis of such magnitude will trigger a set of emotions that gains people's immediate attention, allowing them to store the event in their memory. Some individuals who experience a traumatic event or the loss of a loved one are able to cope with their emotions, while others experience emotional distress and grief. In this lesson, you will learn about emotional distress, the stages of grieving, and strategies to achieve emotional wellness.</p>

<h3>Emotional Distress</h3>
<p>Experiencing trauma or loss can significantly impact the way in which emotions are regulated. When emotions affect the body—whether physically, spiritually, or psychologically—it is referred to as emotional distress. Loss of a family member, friend, or pet and other traumatic incidents can cause emotional distress.</p>

<h3>Who Is at Risk of Emotional Distress?</h3>
> Individuals most at risk for emotional distress include those who:

<ul>
  <li>survived a previous disaster.</li>
  <li>experienced temporary living arrangements, loss of personal property, or personal or parental unemployment. </li>
  <li>lost a loved one or friend.</li>
  <li>lack economic stability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warning Signs</h3>
<p>Adults, teens, and children who are emotionally distressed may exhibit warning signs differently. Review the following warning signs of emotional distress:</p>

# Warning Signs of Stress or Trauma by Age Group

| **Who** | **Warning Signs** |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Adults** | - Eating or sleeping too much or too little  <br> - Pulling away from people and things  <br> - Having low or no energy  <br> - Feeling helpless or hopeless  <br> - Excessive smoking, drinking, or drug use  <br> - Worrying too much; feeling guilty  <br> - Difficulty readjusting to home or work life |
| **Teens (Ages 12–18)** | - Physical complaints (e.g., headaches, stomachaches)  <br> - Less interest in schoolwork, chores, or responsibilities  <br> - Competing vigorously for attention from parents and teachers  <br> - Becoming withdrawn  <br> - Resisting authority  <br> - Becoming disruptive or aggressive  <br> - Experimenting with high-risk behaviors |
| **Children** | - Withdrawing from playgroups and friends  <br> - Competing more for the attention of parents and teachers  <br> - Being unwilling to leave home  <br> - Less interest in schoolwork  <br> - Increased conflict with peers or parents  <br> - Difficulty concentrating  <br> - Becoming aggressive |

<h3>Loss and Grieving</h3>
<p>Have you ever lost a pet, friend, or family member? Or have you ever broken up with a friend or significant other, lost a job, or had a major change in lifestyle? If so, you may have experienced feelings of loss and grief. When you grieve, it's part of the normal process of reacting to a loss. You may experience grief as a mental, physical, social, or emotional reaction. Mental reactions can include anger, guilt, anxiety, sadness, and despair. Physical reactions can include sleeping problems, changes in appetite, physical problems, or illness.</p>

<h3>Responding to a Loss</h3>
<p>Cultural beliefs and traditions can influence how someone mourns or expresses grief and shape how long family members are expected to grieve. Grief is a process of letting go and learning to accept and live with loss. The amount of time it takes to do this varies with each person. Experts say you should let yourself grieve in your own way and time. People have unique ways of expressing emotions. For example, some might express their feelings by doing things rather than talking about their feelings. They may feel better going on a walk or swimming or doing something creative like writing or painting. For others, it may be more helpful to talk with family and friends or a counselor about the loss.</p>

<h3>Stages of Grief</h3>
<p>One way to describe grief is by using the five stages of grief, which were described by psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. These reactions might not occur in a specific order and can occur concurrently. The five stages of grief include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Denial, disbelief, numbness</li>
  <li>Anger, blaming others</li>
  <li>Bargaining (e.g., "If I am cured of this cancer, I will never smoke again.")</li>
  <li>Depressed mood, sadness, and crying</li>
  <li>Acceptance, coming to terms</li>
</ul>

> Grief Symptoms
> TIP:

> Not everyone experiences all of the five stages of grief. However, many people who are grieving have crying spells sleeping, and lack of productivity at work.

# Instructions

## Correct Order of the Five Stages of Grief

1. **Denial**  
   _Many individuals will initially deny or disbelieve the loss of a loved one._

2. **Anger**  
   _After denial, an individual will often express anger towards the person who died and may blame others for the death._

3. **Bargaining**  
   _Many individuals will bargain with themselves or a higher being._

4. **Depression**  
   _At some point, the grieving individual may display a depressed mood, sadness, and crying._

5. **Acceptance**  
   _The final stage of grieving is acceptance._

<h3>Six Strategies for Emotional Wellness</h3>

<p>Emotional wellness is the ability to successfully handle life's stresses and adapt to change and difficult times. The following are six tips to maintain or improve emotional wellness:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Brighten your outlook. People who are emotionally healthy, experts say, have fewer negative emotions and are able to bounce back from difficulties faster. This quality is called resilience. Another sign of emotional wellness is being able to hold onto positive emotions longer and appreciate the "good times."</p></li>
  <li><p>Reduce stress. Everyone feels stressed from time to time. If stress is chronic, those "high-alert" changes become harmful rather than helpful. Learning healthy ways to cope with stress, such as meditation, can also boost your resilience.</p></li>
  <li><p>Get quality sleep. Sleep affects both mental and physical health. It's vital to your well-being. Sleep helps you think more clearly, have quicker reflexes, and focus better. Take steps to make sure you regularly get a good night's sleep.</p></li>
  <li><p>Cope with loss. Although the death of a loved one can feel overwhelming, most people can make it through the grieving process with the support of family and friends. </p></li>
  <li><p>Strengthen social connections. Social connections might help protect health and lengthen life. Scientists are finding that your relationships with others can have powerful effects on your health—both emotionally and physically. Whether with romantic partners, family, friends, neighbors, or others, social connections can influence your biology and well-being.</p></li>
  <li><p>Be mindful. The concept of mindfulness is simple. It's about being completely aware of what's happening in the present—of all that's going on inside and all that's happening around you. It means not living your life on "autopilot." Becoming a more mindful person requires commitment and practice.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>MODULE 14(PG)[80]</h1>

<p>According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, "Drug use at an early age is an important predictor of development of a substance use disorder later. The majority of those who have a substance use disorder started using before age 18 and developed their disorder by age 20." The likelihood of abusing certain types of drugs varies by age. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 are more likely to abuse marijuana, hallucinogens, and inhalants. Young adults aged 18 to 25 are more likely to abuse prescription drugs and heroin. Adults aged 26 and older are more likely to abuse alcohol and cocaine</p>

> After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify the factors associated with substance use, abuse, and treatment and the effect drugs have on the body. 

> Identify types of drugs, warning signs of drug use, and effects of drug use on the body.

<p>Why do people use alcohol and drugs? There are a variety of reasons: to fit in, to feel good, to perform better, and to seek new experiences. Not everyone who tries a drug or drinks alcohol gets addicted. But even if used for a short period of time or recreationally, alcohol and drugs can have adverse effects on every organ in the body. In this lesson, you will learn about the most common types of drugs used, the warning signs of drug abuse, and the effects of drug use and abuse on the body.</p>

<h3>Abuse, Use, and Addiction</h3>
<p>In order to communicate and understand the impact of drugs on the body, it is important to know the differences between use, abuse, and addiction. </p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Use: Substance use is any consumption of alcohol or drugs. For example, having a beer with friends or wine at dinner is considered substance use. Substance use may not be a problem for many people. However, it can lead to abuse or dependency in some people.</li>
  
  <li>Abuse: Substance abuse is when someone continues to use drugs or alcohol even when it causes problems, such as interfering with the ability to work, yielding unhealthy relationships with family, and having an impact on that individual's health. For instance, continuing to use drugs while knowing that you will be fired if you fail a drug test is a sign of abuse.</li>
  
  <li>Addiction: Substance addiction is a dependence on alcohol or drugs. Individuals may be unable to stop drinking or using drugs and have physical withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit (Substance Use, Abuse and Dependence, 2017).</li>
  
</ul>

> Over-the-Counter Vesrsus Prescription Drugs

> TIP:
> <p>For clarification, a drug is a substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Prescription drugs are prescribed by a doctor or qualified licensed health professional, purchased at a pharmacy, intended to be used by one person, and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs do not require a prescription and can be bought at any store where they are available. They are also regulated by the FDA.</p>

<h3>Alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol (ethanol) is the ingredient found in beer, wine, and spirits that causes drunkenness. It is a depressant drug that slows down various parts of the brain and central nervous system. Most people who use alcohol do not have a problem, but it can be toxic and addictive. </p>

<h3>What Is a "Drink"?</h3>
<p>In the United States, a standard drink contains 0.6 ounces (14.0 grams or 1.2 tablespoons) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12 ounces of beer (5% alcohol content)</li>
  <li>8 ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content)</li>
  <li>5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content)</li>
  <li>1.5 ounces of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Much Is Too Much?</h3>

|            | MODERATE     | HEAVY         | BINGE                 |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Female** | 1 per day    | 8 per week    | 4 in a single session  |
| **Male**   | 2 per day    | 15 per week   | 5 in a single session  |

<h3>Warning Signs of Recent Alcohol Use</h3>
> Even one drink of alcohol can have the following mental and physical effects on the body:

<ul>
  <li>slurred speech</li>
  <li>bloodshot, glassy, or watery eyes</li>
  <li>slow responses to questions or comments</li>
  <li>clumsiness, swaying, staggering, or stumbling</li>
  <li>odor of alcohol</li>
  <li>crying or moodiness</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Health Risks of Alcohol Abuse</h3>
<p>Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other serious problems, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heart and digestive problems</li>
  <li>cancer</li>
  <li>learning and memory problems</li>
  <li>mental health problems</li>
  <li>social problems</li>
  <li>alcohol dependence, or alcoholism</li>
  <li>cirrhosis of the liver</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tobacco and Vaping</h3>
<p>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Although the rate of cigarette smoking has decreased, about 34 million American adults still smoke. Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco—including cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco—contain the addictive drug nicotine. Nicotine is readily absorbed into the bloodstream when a tobacco product is chewed, inhaled, or smoked. Upon entering the bloodstream, nicotine immediately stimulates the release of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline). Stimulation is followed by a sedative reaction, causing temporary feelings of relaxation and reduced anxiety.</p>

<h3>E-cigarette Vapor</h3>
<p>Although e-cigarette vapor does not contain the tar currently responsible for most lung cancer and other lung diseases, it has been shown to contain known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, as well as potentially toxic metal particles from the vaporizing mechanism.</p>

<h3>Signs of Recent Tobacco Use</h3>
> Immediate effects of tobacco on the body include the following;

<ul>
  <li>initial stimulation then reduction in activity of the brain and nervous system</li>
  <li>increased alertness and concentration</li>
  <li>feelings of mild euphoria</li>
  <li>feelings of relaxation following stimulation</li>
  <li>increased blood pressure and heart rate</li>
</ul>

<h1>Long-Term Effects of Tobacco Use</h1>
<p>On average, adults who smoke die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking accounts for about 1–3 of all cancers, including 85–90% of lung cancer cases. More people in the United States die from lung cancer than from any other type of cancer. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., chewing tobacco, snuff) also increases the risk of cancer, especially oral cancers. In addition to cancer, smoking causes diseases and health problems, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lung diseases, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema</li>
  <li>heart disease, including stroke, heart attack, vascular disease, and aneurysm</li>
  <li>leukemia</li>
  <li>cataracts</li>
  <li>pneumonia</li>
  <li>risk of miscarriage (pregnant individuals)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cannabis (Marijuana)</h1>
<p>Marijuana is made from the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Marijuana can be smoked through hand-rolled cigarettes (joints); pipes or water pipes (bongs); blunts, which are emptied cigars that have been partly or completely refilled with marijuana; or vaporizers. Marijuana can also be mixed in food (edibles)</p>

<h3>Signs of Recent Marijuana Use</h3>
<p>When a person smokes marijuana, THC quickly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream and then to the brain and other organs throughout the body. Symptoms of recent marijuana use include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>altered senses (e.g., seeing brighter colors)</li>
  <li>altered sense of time</li>
  <li>changes in mood</li>
  <li>impaired body movements</li>
  <li>increased heart rate</li>
  <li>difficulties with thinking, problem-solving, and memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Effects of Marijuana Use on the Body</h3>
<p>Marijuana use impairs short-term memory, judgment, and perception. Long-term use may have a wide range of physical and mental effects, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>impaired brain development for fetuses exposed to marijuana</li>
  <li>impaired thinking, memory, and learning functions</li>
  <li>hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis (when taken in high doses)</li>
  <li>breathing problems, similar to smoking tobacco</li>
</ul>

> Use of Edibles

> Tip: 
> Individuals who consume marijuana in foods or beverages have delayed effects—usually appearing after 30–60 minutes—because the drug must first pass through the digestive system. Eating or drinking marijuana delivers significantly less THC into the bloodstream than smoking an equivalent amount of the plant. Because of the delayed effects, people may inadvertently consume more THC than they intend to.

<h3>Depressants</h3>
<p>Over 130 people die every day from opioid overdoses. Over 2.1 million Americans have an opioid use disorder, and 11.4 million people misuse prescription opioids.2 Opioids (heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone) are narcotics. They are in a class of drugs called depressants because they act as a central nervous system depressant. Depressants are used to help induce sleep, stop pain, and relieve anxiety and muscle spasms. Alcohol and sedatives (Valium) also fall into the depressants category. </p>

<h1>Signs of Recent Use of Depressants</h1>
<p>At fairly low doses, depressants have the following effects on the body:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dry mouth</li>
  <li>Mild euphoria</li>
  <li>Lack of inhibition</li>
  <li>Poor concentration</li>
  <li>Clouded mental function</li>
  <li>Sleepiness</li>
  <li>Slurred speech and other signs similar to the use of alcohol</li>
  <li>Uncoordinated muscle movement of eyes, speech, and movement (higher doses)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Effects of Depressants on the Body </h3>
<p>People who engage in drug use or high-risk behaviors associated with drug use put themselves at risk. The following are long-term effects of using depressants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Addiction</li>
  <li>Increased risk of overdose incidents</li>
  <li>Increased risk of motor vehicle crashes</li>
  <li>increased tolerance to effects</li>
  <li>Increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or hepatitis (if injecting drug)</li>
  <li>Death</li>
</ul>

<h1>Stimulants</h1>
<p>Stimulants are drugs that temporarily increase alertness and energy. Prescription stimulant medicines are generally used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy—uncontrollable episodes of deep sleep. Cocaine and methamphetamines are commonly used street drugs that fall into this class of drugs. </p>

> Methamphetamine and Cocaine

<p>Methamphetamine, also known as meth, is an extremely addictive stimulant usually found as a white, bitter-tasting powder or a pill. Crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth) is a form of the drug that looks like glass fragments or shiny, bluish-white rocks.2 Cocaine is a powerfully addictive drug made from the leaves of the coca plant native to South America. Cocaine and methamphetamine increase the levels of the natural chemical messenger dopamine in brain circuits related to the control of movement and reward. Depending on the drug, it may be snorted through the nose, rubbed into the gums, smoked, or injected into the bloodstream.</p>

> Signs of Recent Use of Stimulants

> Short-term side effects include the following:

<ul>
  <li>Extreme happiness and energy</li>
  <li>Mental alertness</li>
  <li>Hypersensitivity to sight, sound, and touch</li>
  <li>Irritability</li>
  <li>Paranoia (extreme and unreasonable distrust of others)</li>
  <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Effects of Stimulants on the Body</h3>
<p>Common long-term effects include erratic and violent behavior, panic attacks, paranoia, psychosis, heart rhythm problems, heart attack, stroke, seizure, and coma. Other effects depend on the method of use and include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snorting: loss of smell, nosebleeds</li>
  <li>Smoking: cough, asthma, respiratory distress</li>
  <li>Injection: higher risk for contracting HIV, hepatitis C, and other bloodborne diseases</li>
</ul>

> Nicotine

> Tip: 
> Nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative; therefore, it does not fall into this category.

> Identify signs of drug addiction and the principles of treatment.

<p>Can someone be cured for a drug addiction or just treated? Despite being aware of harmful outcomes, many people who use drugs continue to take them, which is the nature of addiction. It's common for a person to relapse, but relapse does not mean that treatment will not work. In this lesson, you will learn the signs of drug addiction and the principles of treatment.</p>

<h1>Understanding Substance Abuse and Addiction</h1>
<p>Many people don't understand why or how other people become addicted to drugs. They mistakenly think that those who use drugs lack moral principles or willpower and that they could stop their drug use simply by choosing to. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will. Drugs change the brain in ways that make quitting hard, even for those who want to. Fortunately, researchers know more than ever about how drugs affect the brain and have found treatments that can help people recover from drug addiction and lead productive lives. </p>

<h3>What is Drug Addiction?</h3>
<p>Addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences. The initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, but repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person's self-control and interfere with that individual's ability to resist the intense urges to take drugs. These brain changes can be persistent, which is why drug addiction is considered a "relapsing" disease. People in recovery from drug use disorders are at increased risk of returning to drug use even after years of abstinence.</p>

<h1>Signs of Drug Addiction</h1>
<p>How do you know if someone has a drug use problem? People with drug problems might not act as they used to. You may notice behavioral, physical, and emotional changes. The following are common signs of drug abuse and addiction (Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, 2019</p>

| **KEY IDEA**                  | **SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No Money** 💸              | - Neglecting responsibilities at school, work, or home  <br> - Legal trouble (e.g., DUI, stealing) <br> - Financial trouble                               |
| **Bloodshot Eye** 👁️         | - Bloodshot eyes, pupils larger or smaller than usual <br> - Changes in eating/sleeping patterns <br> - Poor hygiene, unusual smells <br> - Impaired coordination |
| **Secretive** 🤫              | - Drop in attendance/performance at work or school <br> - Secretive or suspicious behaviors <br> - Isolating from family/friends <br> - Risk-taking behavior |
| **Angry** 😠                  | - Unexplained change in personality or attitude <br> - Sudden mood swings <br> - Irritability or angry outbursts                                           |
<h1>Principles of Treatment</h1>
<p>As with most other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, treatment for drug addiction generally isn't a cure. However, addiction is treatable and can be successfully managed. People who are recovering from an addiction will be at risk for relapse for years and possibly for their whole lives. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient's drug use patterns and any co-occurring medical, mental, and social problems can lead to continued recovery.</p>

> There are many options that have been successful in treating drug addiction, including the following:

<ul>
  <li>Behavioral counseling</li>
  <li>Medication</li>
  <li>Medical devices and applications such as neurostimulation, used to treat withdrawal symptoms or deliver skills training</li>
  <li>Evaluation and treatment for co-occurring mental health issues such as depression and anxiety</li>
  <li>Long-term follow-up to prevent relapse</li>
</ul>

> Identify factors associated with stress and the effect that stress has on the body.

<h3>Positive Stress—Does it Exist?</h3>

<p>Perhaps you always associate stress with something negative. But stress can also be positive and beneficial when you recognize the signs and circumstances. For example, when you face a dangerous situation, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, and your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival. This "fight or flight" stress response has served mankind well over thousands of years. </p>

<h3>Optimizing Levels of Stress for Learning</h3>

<p>Students have often experienced a need to maintain optimal levels of stress over the course of their academic careers. Think about how much stress you experience toward the end of a term. You may feel overwhelmed with work and exams. At that point, your stress level may be too high. Once you finish the term, however, it doesn't take long before you begin to feel bored. Your stress level is too low, and your performance is also typically lower. By the time the next term starts, you can't wait for school to start.</p>

<h3>Causes of Stress</h3>

<p>There is no single source of stress. Remember that what is stressful for you may not affect someone else. Stress happens when people of any age feel they don't have the tools to manage the demands in their lives. Stress can be short-term or long-term. Missing the bus or arguing with your spouse or partner can cause short-term stress. Money problems or trouble at work or school can cause long-term stress. Even happy events, like having a baby or getting married, can cause stress.</p>

<h4>Common causes of short-term stress include the following:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Needing to do a lot in a short amount of time</li>
  <li>Experiencing many small problems in the same day, like a traffic jam or running late</li>
  <li>Getting lost</li>
  <li>Having an argument</li>
  <li>Performing in school (achievement or failure)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common causes of long-term stress include the following:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Having problems at work or at home</li>
  <li>Changing your job or marital status</li>
  <li>Having money problems</li>
  <li>Being bullied (at school, after school, online)</li>
  <li>Caring for someone with a serious illness</li>
  <li>Enduring a chronic (ongoing) illness</li>
  <li>Experiencing the death of a loved one</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responding to Stress</h3>

<p>The fight-or-flight response (also called the stress response) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived threat or danger. This enables the body to act quickly and is intended to avoid physical harm. Unfortunately for your health, this response also occurs when you are not in any immediate physical danger but are still experiencing stress. For example, this can happen when someone is running late for an appointment or class and is feeling stressed about trying to get there.</p>

<p>The fight-or-flight response is also recognized as the first stage of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), which describes the pattern of responses the body goes through after being prompted by a stressor.</p>

> Response to All Stress

> TIP:
> It's important to remember that these changes occur in the body whether the perceived stressor is positive or negative. Knowing this information will encourage you to take active steps in managing the stress in your life because it can build up and potentially cause harm to your health.

<h3>Effects of Stress on the Body</h3>
<p>According to the American Psychological Association (2019), even short-lived (acute) stress affects the body. For example, giving a presentation may cause "butterflies" in the stomach or induce a migraine headache. Over time, the physical changes that occur during this response can cause wear and tear within the body if the perception of stress persists. </p>

> Stress and Ulcers

> TIP:
> Contrary to popular belief, stress does not increase acid production in the stomach or cause stomach ulcers. Stomach ulcers are actually caused by a bacterial infection.


<h3>Psychological Effects of Stress</h3>
> In addition to physical effects, some people who are under stress may experience a number of other effects:

<ul>
  <li>Worry</li>
  <li>Anger</li>
  <li>Irritability</li>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Forgetfulness</li>
  <li>Inability to focus</li>
</ul>

| **Charlene** <br>*(Overwhelmed by tasks)*                             | ✅ Write a list of the things that are causing stress <br> ✅ Go out for a short walk before planning           | Listing stressors helps identify solvable problems. <br> A short walk helps relax tense muscles and improves mood.                              |
| **Ineffective Options**                                               | ❌ Go to bed and make a list in the morning <br> ❌ Start solving the biggest task                              | Postponing can increase anxiety. <br> Tackling the biggest task first may feel overwhelming.                                                    |

| **Ineffective Options**                                               | ❌ Start a low-carbohydrate diet <br> ❌ Get 10 hours of sleep                                                  | Changing diet doesn’t directly address current stress. <br> Too much sleep can disrupt balance and productivity.                                |
| **David** <br>*(Full-time worker & grad student, constantly anxious)* | ✅ Find time to stretch <br> ✅ Take a slow walk and listen to music <br> ✅ Use long, slow breathing techniques | These are relaxation techniques that trigger the body’s natural calming response: reduced heart rate, lower blood pressure, and mental clarity. |
| **Ineffective Option**                                                | ❌ Complete his schoolwork at a coffee shop                                                                    | While helpful for productivity, it doesn't directly support relaxation.                                                                         |

| **Positive Attitude & Problem Solving** | Develop a new mindset toward stress. Identify stressors, focus on what you can control, and take small, manageable steps to solve problems.                                                                       |
| **Physical Self-Care**                  | Support your body with **quality sleep**, **nutritious foods**, and **regular physical activity** to improve resilience against stress.                                                                           |
| **Social Connections**                  | Build strong relationships. **Talk to others**, **share your stress**, and seek **support** when needed to reduce feelings of isolation and anxiety.                                                              |
| **Relaxation Techniques**               | Use tools like **meditation**, **deep breathing**, and **stretching** to trigger the body’s **natural relaxation response** — leading to slower breathing, reduced blood pressure, and greater emotional balance. |

<h1>MODULE 16(PG)[95]</h1>

> Identify the characteristics and application of social and emotional learning.

<h3>Social and Emotional Skills and Development</h3>
<p>You interact with others, make decisions, recognize and manage your feelings, and react to events on a daily basis. The skills you need to perform these behaviors are not innate; they are learned. However, the process of learning these types of skills is quite different from the process you use to learn concepts in content areas, such as science or math. The skills you need for daily life are often referred to as "soft skills." These skills are developed as the result of a process called social and emotional learning, or SEL.</p>

<h3>Social and Emotional Skill Development in Children</h3>
<p>A young boy offers a cherished toy to a little girl because he can see that the girl is sad, and he feels sad, too, as a result. His parent praises him for this expression of empathy.</p>

<p>Babies are not born knowing how to manage their emotions or set and achieve goals. Children do not automatically know how to develop and maintain positive relationships or make responsible decisions. There are well-established developmental milestones for social and emotional development in children, but these skills are taught, learned, and developed (Cherry, 2018).</p>

> Social and Emotional Skill Development in Adults

<p>A colleague notices that you are distracted, and perhaps upset, at the staff meeting. She checks in with you after the meeting and asks how you are doing. You thank her for her concern.</p>

<p>While adults do not have developmental milestones for SEL, adults can still learn and develop SEL skills. For example, a skill such as empathy, which is essential for getting along with others, can be further developed in adulthood. Self-awareness, reflection, and social awareness, along with learning about specific empathy principles and consciously practicing certain activities, can help people develop empathy (Srinivasan, 2018).</p>

> Children Versus Adults

> TIP:
> The differences between social and emotional learning in children and adults stem from the context of an adult's cognitive and emotional maturity and the application of the skills in an adult's life.

<p>How would you describe SEL to a friend or colleague? You may choose to explain the five areas of SEL skill development. That approach is helpful, but you may also want to use examples that illustrate the characteristics and attributes of SEL. Review the following chart with a description of each characteristic of SEL.</p>

| **Characteristic**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lifelong Process**                       | SEL supports continuous personal growth by encouraging self-reflection and understanding of learning throughout all life stages.                     |
| **Focus on the Affective Domain**          | SEL emphasizes emotional development, empathy, relationship skills, and social interaction.                                                          |
| **Workplace Relevance**                    | SEL cultivates skills such as responsibility, self-management, teamwork, decision-making, and problem-solving—valued by employers in all industries. |
| **Occurs in Formal and Informal Settings** | SEL takes place in classrooms, workplaces, and everyday situations—especially when approached deliberately and with self-reflection.                 |
| **Measurable Skills**                      | Social and emotional competencies can be assessed and tracked, showing progress in areas like self-awareness and social management.                  |

| **Statement**                                                                                          | **True / False** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SEL requires a lot of time and effort to be incorporated into a person's life.**                     | **False**        | Misconception — SEL can be integrated into everyday activities and does not require significant extra time.                      |
| **SEL can be developed and practiced in a variety of settings and ways.**                              | **True**         | Characteristic — SEL happens in both formal and informal settings like school, home, and work.                                   |
| **SEL promotes the idea that a person needs to be outgoing in order to be successful professionally.** | **False**        | Misconception — SEL supports all personality types; being outgoing is not a requirement for success.                             |
| **SEL is a process that continues through adulthood and can be developed throughout life.**            | **True**         | Characteristic — SEL is a lifelong process that continues well beyond childhood.                                                 |
| **SEL helps people develop skills that are practical and can be applied in the workplace.**            | **True**         | Characteristic — SEL builds skills like collaboration, self-management, and problem-solving, which are valued in all workplaces. |

## **Social and Emotional Learning Benefits**

SEL skills provide several key benefits to your health, performance in school and work, relationships, and community:

* Improved overall health, including stress reduction
* Reduction in unhealthy behaviors
* Improved academic performance
* Increased productivity at work
* Increased empathy and social awareness
* Improved ability to contribute to the community
* Improved ability to adapt to rapid change

---

### **Health and Wellness**

 **Mindfulness**
SEL skills, such as mindfulness, are a key part of stress reduction and benefit your overall health and wellness. Self-reflection and mindfulness can help you recognize when stress leads to unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse or violence (Foundations Recovery Network, 2019). SEL skills can help reduce those types of behaviors.

---

### **Achievement in School and at Work**

SEL skills are beneficial to your performance in school and your productivity at work. Managing commitments and motivating yourself to set and achieve goals is essential to success in school and at work. Many business professionals emphasize that SEL skills benefit not just the individual employee but entire teams and organizations. These skills can be as important as having content-area expertise (Suess, 2015).

---

### **Stronger Professional and Personal Relationships**

 **Relationships**
SEL skills benefit your personal and professional relationships. They can help you develop empathy and learn how to gauge the feelings and needs of others so you can react appropriately in a given situation. Practicing empathy and demonstrating respect for friends and family creates trust and strengthens relationships. According to *Psychology Today* (2018), healthy relationships may be the most important contributing factor to a person's overall health and well-being.

---

### **Community, Society, and Adaptability**

SEL skills benefit you by providing continual growth and learning throughout your life. This growth improves your ability to contribute to your community. People who develop their executive function skills tend to be lifelong learners. People with these skills are 20% more likely to be involved with and support community organizations. Contributing to community efforts and lifelong learning can help you keep your brain alert and improve your ability to adapt to change (Ezeofor, 2019). The ability to adapt rapidly will benefit all aspects of your life.

---

### **Benefits to Individuals**

If you have flown on a commercial airline, you likely recognize the following direction: *"Put your own oxygen mask on first before helping others."* The message is clear: you need to take care of yourself in order to take care of others.

Every individual needs SEL skills for their own well-being and to live fulfilled lives. When an employee learns about the factors that affect how people respond to each other—such as how to identify their own emotions and their colleagues' emotions and expressed feelings—they are better able to reduce stress, achieve goals, create positive relationships, and find fulfillment in their work.

Here are the **three benefits Maria will experience** by using SEL skills, based on the scenario provided:

---

###  **Maria’s SEL Benefits:**

1. **Increased empathy and social awareness**
   → Maria demonstrates empathy by considering her coworker’s perspective and being open to a different organizational method.

2. **Improved ability to adapt rapidly to change**
   → She is flexible and willing to change her own system after realizing the new idea might be more efficient.

3. **Increased productivity at work**
   → By collaborating with the coworker and implementing a better system, workplace efficiency and productivity are likely to improve.

<h1>Module 17(PG)[99]</h1>

<p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation in which you didn't even realize you were angry until you lost your temper? Have you been surprised when a friend or colleague complimented you on a skill you didn't realize you had? As you become more self-aware, you learn to recognize your emotions and understand yourself. You come to understand, in a deliberate and conscientious way, who you are and why you do what you do.</p>

<p>This may seem simple and straightforward. Interestingly, researchers have found that most people think they are more self-aware than they actually are. In one often-cited study, 95% of the participants reported that they were self-aware, while researchers found that only about 15% of them actually truly were (Kauflin, 2017). After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify the application of self-awareness skills in educational, professional, and personal development settings. </p>

| **Skill**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recognizing Emotions** | The ability to distinguish between various emotional states and understand how they affect your physical body, behavior, and attitudes.           |

| **Introduction** | Are there people in your life you admire for their ability to manage stress, persist when things are difficult, and get a lot accomplished? If so, it is likely that they have good self-management skills. Self-management can help you understand how to manage your emotions, manage stress, build resilience, and persevere through challenges so that you are able to make the best use of your time and achieve your goals. In this lesson, you will learn what self-management is, why it is important, and what it looks like when applied to daily life. |
| **Self-Management Overview** | Do you have a personal mission statement? Do you know what your priorities are and how they align with the goals you have for your life? Self-management can help you manage your behavior so that you can live a life that aligns with your personal mission statement and life goals. |
| **What Is Self-Management?** | Self-management is the ability to accept responsibility for, be accountable for, and effectively manage one's own emotions, behavior, actions, and well-being. Self-management skills help an individual become organized and more effective in their endeavors by incorporating systems, strategies, and mindsets to achieve optimal outcomes and results. |
| **Examples of Self-Management in Everyday Life** | |
| **Maya** | Maya is preparing to return to her third-grade classroom after summer break. Maya felt overwhelmed at this point the previous year. She knows that starting out organized will help minimize back-to-school stress for herself and her students. To ensure she is prepared, she organizes the materials and space in her classroom. She reviews curriculum material to remember the broader year-end goals and solidifies lesson plans for the first few weeks. |
| **William** | William has recently been promoted at work. He knows that his new position will initially require more time and focus than his last one. He also realizes that it will be stressful in the first few months. He and his wife have young children, and their home life is very busy. He plans on working longer days at least a few nights a week. William knows that exercising and spending time with people he enjoys will help him manage the stress of the new job. He schedules time to jog in the mornings. He also reserves Friday nights for the family and schedules to have coffee with a friend one day over the weekend. |

| **The Role of Emotion in Self-Awareness and Self-Management** | Both self-awareness and self-management involve understanding and regulating emotions and related behaviors. However, one major difference is that self-awareness focuses on the recognition and identification of emotions, while self-management focuses on how people handle their emotions and their ability to modify their external behavior in response to emotions. Self-management is informed and guided by self-awareness. |
| **Characteristics of Self-Management** | People with strong self-management skills tend to: <ul><li>Manage daily and ongoing stress</li><li>Recover from adversity</li><li>Avoid reacting on impulse</li><li>Are self-motivated</li><li>Establish goals and make plans to achieve them</li><li>Organize priorities and manage time</li><li>Ignore distractions and maintain focus on tasks</li></ul> |
| **Scenario Example** | A fellow student calls and expresses frustration about writing a paper. He almost deletes his draft but instead takes deep breaths and a break. The next day, he sets a goal to finish in two days, makes a plan (starting with an outline), and puts his phone in another room to stay focused. He demonstrates:<ul><li>Manages stress</li><li>Does not react on impulse</li><li>Sets goals and makes plans</li><li>Ignores distractions and stays focused</li></ul> |
| **Tip: Let Go of Multitasking** | While multitasking may seem efficient, only 2% of people can do it effectively. For most, multitasking reduces productivity. |
| **Self-Management Benefits** | <ul><li>Improved relationships, even in difficult situations</li><li>Better physical and mental health</li><li>Greater focus, even with distractions</li><li>Better decision-making</li><li>Accomplish more in less time = more free time and less stress</li><li>Improved learning outcomes and success in school/work</li><li>Greater self-confidence and self-esteem</li></ul> |
| **Question 2 – Example Response** | *Prompt:* How can you benefit in your professional career from self-management?<br>**Sample Answer:** The way I can improve from self-management would first be to set up and formulate 3 goals. From there, I would give each goal 1 main focus area and then allocate constructive timed intervals for work and stress management. |
| **Lesson Summary** | <ul><li>Self-management = taking responsibility for your emotions, behavior, and well-being</li><li>Involves being self-motivated, focused, organized, and resilient</li><li>Leads to better health, relationships, productivity, learning, and confidence</li></ul> |

| **Introduction to Self-Management Skills** | You now know that self-management can benefit you in many areas of your life. In this lesson, you will learn about three of the key skills that can help you achieve these benefits: stress management, goal setting, and self-discipline. |
| **Self-Management: Stress Management Skills** | You can probably easily describe a recent event or situation that was stressful. How did you manage it? What worked well, and what did not? |
| **Definition: Stress Management** | Stress management is the process of managing factors that cause anxiety and maintaining overall well-being. |
| **Positive Stress** | Positive stress is energizing and motivational. It can help you focus and achieve goals, often occurring when you're looking forward to something you feel prepared for. |
| **Negative Stress** | Negative stress causes anxiety, reduces performance, and can leave you feeling overwhelmed. It often occurs when you feel unequipped to handle a situation. |
| **Individual Differences in Stress** | What people find stressful varies from person to person. For example, public speaking might be positively stressful for some, and negatively stressful for others. |
| **Importance of Managing Negative Stress** | Learning to manage negative stress is essential for maintaining both physical and mental health. |
| **Stress Management Strategies** | Stress management strategies fall into two main categories: eliminating stressors and using relief techniques. |
| **Eliminate Unnecessary Stressors** | <ul><li>Practice getting rid of negative thoughts</li><li>Recognize and end unhealthy relationships when possible</li><li>Reduce clutter and create an organized environment</li></ul> |
| **Use Relief Strategies** | <ul><li>Practice deep breathing and count slowly with each breath</li><li>Relax muscles progressively and observe changes</li><li>Visualize peaceful and calming settings</li><li>Maintain healthy habits: regular exercise, enough rest, and meaningful social time</li></ul> |

| **Section** | **Content** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Managing Stress – Tip** | To manage stress caused by feeling overwhelmed, focus on your senses instead of your thoughts. Simple grounding exercises, such as holding an object and describing its texture or listening to relaxing music, can help calm both children and adults. |
| **Did I Get This – Question 1** | **Scenario:**<br>Hannah takes her dog for a walk. The dog escapes the leash and runs off. Hannah starts to panic but instead takes deep breaths to calm down. She uses treats to call the dog back successfully. Later, still feeling some stress, she goes for a run and takes a bath while listening to relaxing music. |
| **Identified Stress Management Techniques** | <ul><li>**Practiced deep breathing** – Paused and took deep breaths to manage initial panic</li><li>**Removed negative thoughts** – Reframed the situation with a calm plan (calling the dog with treats)</li><li>**Incorporated exercise** – Went for a run and used relaxing music to reduce lingering stress</li></ul> |
| **Incorrect Options (Not Demonstrated)** | <ul><li>Recognized unhealthy relationships</li><li>Reduced clutter and created an organized environment</li></ul> |
| **Explanation** | Hannah effectively managed stress by using multiple techniques from both categories: eliminating negative stressors and using stress-relief strategies. Her actions demonstrate how self-awareness and coping strategies work together in real-life situations. |

| **Goal Setting as a Self-Management Skill** | Goal setting is an essential skill for achieving personal and professional milestones. It plays a key role in self-management by helping you stay organized, manage your time, and build the structure needed for self-discipline and success. |
| **Definition: SMART Goals** | SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. Research shows that people are more successful when their goals follow this structure. SMART goals provide clarity, motivation, and a way to track progress. |
| **SMART Goals Breakdown** | **SMART GOALS** | **QUESTIONS TO DEVELOP SMART GOALS** |
| Specific | Does the goal answer who, what, when, where, and why? |
| Measurable | How will I know when I've met the goal? Can I measure the goal by how often I accomplish something or how much I achieve? |
| Achievable | How realistic is the goal? What can help me reach the goal? What will help me make progress toward achieving the goal? |
| Relevant | Is the goal worthwhile? Do I have the skills or information I need, or can I get them? Does this goal align with my needs? |
| Timely | What is a reasonable schedule for my goal? What can I do today? What can I do in the next few months? |

| **Statement** | **SMART Goal Component** | **Explanation** |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Survey volunteers to verify the program is worthwhile and determine interest and availability | **Relevant** | This ensures the goal aligns with actual needs and interests. |
| Plan and launch a volunteer dog-walking program with existing volunteers within six months | **Specific** | Clearly defines who, what, when, and how — making it a concrete goal. |
| Begin with a goal of each dog receiving at least three volunteer-led walks per week (given volunteer capacity) | **Achievable** | The goal is realistic based on current resources (volunteer capacity). |
| Begin with three walks a week, and at the end of three months, review the program | **Measurable** | Progress can be tracked through the number of walks and a planned review. |
| At the end of three months, review the program and make adjustments needed to attain the six-month goal | **Timely** | Sets both short-term and long-term timelines to keep the goal on track. |

> Setting SMART Goals with Groups

> Tip: 
> When working with others, such as a group of students or a team at work, you may wish to augment the "achievable" part of a SMART goal with "agreed upon." You want to be sure that everyone agrees with the goals and has the same understanding of what the goals mean.

<p>Effective interpersonal communicators are empathetic rather than sympathetic. Understanding how to communicate with empathy, resolve conflicts, and collaborate within teams will help you become a more effective communicator. In this lesson, you will learn about empathy, conflict resolution, and collaboration and teamwork, three key skills that can help you achieve the benefits of effective communication.</p>

<h3>Interpersonal Communication: Empathy</h3>
<p>Have you ever been so involved in a character's story in a book or a film that you find yourself imagining yourself as this character? Perhaps you find yourself understanding the character's emotions and seeing a situation from their perspective, even if it is different from your own. Empathy  is the ability to imagine yourself in another person's situation and understand that person's feelings and perspectives. </p>

<h3>Empathy versus Sympathy</h3>
<p>Empathy is not interchangeable in meaning with sympathy. Sympathy is compassion for or commiseration with another, whereas empathy is the ability to imagine oneself in another person's position and to experience all the sensations associated with it. Empathy is about actually understanding someone's feelings. When empathizing, you imagine how another person feels. This does not mean you completely adopt the person's feelings or agree with their feelings; it means you want them to feel understood. There is nothing wrong with expressing sympathy. However, sympathy does not usually help resolve a problem or result in understanding as effectively as empathy does.</p>

#  Sympathy vs. Empathy

##  Example Scenario

A new employee says:

> "I was late this morning due to a bad accident on the freeway. So I did not have time to get the materials printed for the presentation. Instead of delivering a clear, concise presentation, most of my colleagues were confused, which also reflected poorly on my boss."

###  Response with Sympathy:

> "Oh, that is a shame. I am sorry you had a stressful day."

- **Focus:** Acknowledges distress but stays distant from the experience.

###  Response with Empathy:

> "That sounds nerve-racking! Are you worried about disappointing your colleagues? I know that those kits can be frustrating to get printed. It took me a while, but I figured out some shortcuts that I can share with you."

- **Focus:** Validates feelings, connects to experience, offers help.

---

##  Empathy and Effective Communication

Listening with the intent to **understand others' perspectives**:
- Helps you *understand others*
- Helps *others feel understood*

### ✅ Tips:
- **Paraphrase** or reiterate what someone said to check your understanding.
- **Demonstrate genuine interest** to create open, supportive environments.
- Empathetic people can **anticipate others’ needs** more effectively.

---

##  Strategies for Developing Empathy

Empathy can be developed through intentional habits:

| **Strategy**           | **Description**                                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cultivate curiosity** | Ask questions about others’ experiences instead of making assumptions.                       |
| **Diversify experiences** | Connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds to challenge and expand perception. |
| **Read quality literature** | Stories with complex characters deepen understanding of unfamiliar thoughts and feelings.      |

## ✅ Summary

| **Sympathy**                     | **Empathy**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acknowledges distress            | Shares and understands the emotional experience                             |
| Feels sorry for someone          | Feels with someone                                                          |
| Distant concern                  | Deep connection through shared or imagined experience                       |
| Passive support                  | Active listening, understanding, and often helpful action                   |

Empathy is a cornerstone of effective interpersonal communication and leadership.

<h3>Interpersonal Communication: Conflict Resolution</h3>

<p>Almost 60 percent of employees in the United States have never received basic conflict management and dispute resolution training (Short, 2016). Yet business leaders cite the ability to resolve conflicts as a critically important interpersonal communication and leadership skill. Conflict resolution is the ability to use a variety of communication techniques—including assertiveness, persuasion, perspective-taking, and cooperation—to negotiate and resolve disagreements. While conflict resolution can help you in your professional life, you can also use this skill at home, in school, and in your community.</p>

# Conflict Resolution Scenario

## Scenario

You and a fellow student are developing a final project to present at the end of the semester. You’re excited and confident about your unique idea. However, near the end of the semester, you discover that another team is creating a nearly identical project—different from what they initially proposed.

You try to set up a meeting with the other group to discuss the issue. Your partner delays the meeting three times. When the meeting finally happens, your partner says he feels like giving up. Then, during the meeting, he becomes angry and tells the other students that your team's ideas are better and they shouldn't be allowed to proceed.

---

## Question 1: What Did the Partner Do to Cause Conflict?

**Answer:**

The partner did not use stress management skills to identify his state of mind and to assess the situation and act accordingly.

**Explanation:**
- The partner initially avoided the situation.
- Later, he responded with aggression and competitiveness.
- He failed to regulate emotions or engage in collaborative problem-solving.

---

## Question 2: Which Three Actions Represent a More Effective Approach?

| Action                                                                                          | Reason                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You ask everyone what they ultimately want in order to be successful in the class.              | Refocuses the discussion on shared goals and outcomes.                                               |
| You suggest identifying which components of each team's work meet the project objectives.       | Encourages logical evaluation based on work done and alignment with the assignment.                 |
| You propose creating a group of four to combine ideas from both teams.                          | Promotes collaboration, compromise, and innovation.                                                  |

**Ineffective Options:**

- Suggesting to end the meeting because your partner is too angry  
  - This avoids resolution instead of managing the issue.

- Agreeing with your partner that the other team shouldn't move forward  
  - Escalates conflict and displays bias rather than leadership.

What enables people to manage and process a lot of information, ignore distractions, and make responsible decisions? It is done through an information-processing and decision-making system called executive function that involves the brain. Think of executive function as the air traffic control system of the brain. According to Harvard University, "Executive function skills help us plan, focus attention, switch gears, and juggle multiple tasks—much like an air traffic control system at a busy airport" (Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2011). After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify the application of executive function skills in educational, professional, and personal development settings.

<h3>Identify the skills associated with executive function.</h3>

<p>No matter how intelligent an adult is, they will not be able to accomplish much without executive function. People are not born with executive function, but they are born with the potential to develop it. While executive function is typically developed throughout early adulthood, studies in neuroplasticity—the ability of the brain to remain flexible and to grow—show that adults can continue to develop these skills, no matter how old they become. In this lesson, you will learn about three skills that can help individuals develop their executive function: adaptability, problem-solving, and self-directed learning.</p>

<h3>Executive Function Skill: Adaptability</h3>

<p>Studies have found that people who are adaptable often outperform and have greater job satisfaction than those who are less flexible. For example, a study of retail employees found that adaptability improves job performance in the long term. This is likely because people who are flexible thinkers understand the broader context of their job and can adapt to changing situations and environments. Improved job performance can lead to greater job satisfaction.</p>

<h3>What Is Adaptability?</h3>
<p>Adaptabillity is the ability to effectively adjust to changing situations and conditions. A person who is adaptable can adjust to changing roles, jobs, responsibilities, schedules, and work environments in a climate of ambiguity and fluctuation. Adaptability requires cognitive flexibility and the capacity to embrace change.</p>

<h3>Adaptability: A Restaurant Example </h3>
<p>Sam is allergic to tomatoes. A few weeks ago, he went to a new restaurant and saw a dish on the menu that sounded really good, but it contained diced tomatoes. He asked the server if he could have that dish prepared without the tomatoes. The server returned a few minutes later and said, "The chef says the dish comes with diced tomatoes. He suggests you order something else." Sam had thought his request was reasonable, but he accepted the server's answer and ordered something else. Sam returned to the same restaurant the following week and decided to make the same request for the dish he wanted. When the server returned this time, he said the chef could leave the tomatoes out. Sam explained what happened the previous week and asked what had changed. The server replied that there was a different chef on duty.

In this situation, the second chef is flexible and willing to adapt the recipe to suit Sam's request. </p>

<h3>Advantages of Adaptability</h3>
                                
<p>While there are some situations in which adaptability may not be possible, being able to adapt to changing circumstances will serve you well in most aspects of life at home, at work, at school, and in the community. You will be more likely to experiment and, therefore, more likely to find unexpected solutions to problems. Learning new skills will be easier, as will dealing with challenges and rebounding from adversity. Being viewed as flexible and cooperative will benefit your relationships and build your leadership capabilities.</p>

<h3>Example of Social Awareness in Action</h3>

<p>Lulu is a regular customer at Orange Zest Café, which is near downtown and on her way to work. The people who frequent the café represent the ethnic and racial diversity of the city. Regular customers include construction workers, office workers, students, parents, and retirees. Ahmed, the café manager, is usually at the register when Lulu gets her coffee. He is equally friendly to everyone, remembers people by name, and is always interested to hear how his customers are doing. Lulu notices that Ahmed knows how to respond positively to customers who are agitated, as well as to those who want to chat and linger, even when there is a long line behind them.

One day, Lulu realizes that Charlotte, a regular customer with whom she often chats, has not been to the cafe in a while. Lulu wonders if perhaps Charlotte has moved or changed jobs. However, a few months later, Charlotte is at the café. Ahmed greets Charlotte and tells her how happy he is to see that she is well enough to come in. Charlotte thanks Ahmed for his thoughtfulness during her illness. On Lulu's way out, Charlotte tells her that Ahmed learned about her illness and had his son deliver her favorite orange scones to her home, along with cards and well wishes.

Can you see how Ahmed, his business, and his customers all benefit from social awareness in this situation?</p>

# Manager with Sociability Skills vs. Manager without Sociability Skills

**Manager with Sociability Skills**  
Talia knows a lot about market research and is always happy to share what she has learned with others. Her team views her as a person with integrity who cares about them both personally and professionally and can bring out the best in them. She meets with team members regularly and asks how they are doing. She is an effective communicator who pays attention to what people say as well as what they convey nonverbally. She collaborates with the team and encourages collaboration within the team because it can solve problems and help team members work more effectively with one another.  

**Manager without Sociability Skills**  
Eva knows a lot about marketing and is a brilliant market researcher. However, she is almost always certain that she knows the best way to solve every problem. She doesn't notice when the people on her team disagree with her approach to solving a problem and does not collaborate with her team. At meetings, she presents well-researched findings but is unaware of the effect of her communication. She doesn't notice or respond when others are confused. She rarely asks her team members how they are doing and doesn't feel personally connected with them, nor do they feel connected to her.  

As you may imagine, any employee—manager or not—who has well-developed sociability will be more successful in getting along with others and being productive and effective than someone who lacks these skills. Sociability is a skill that is widely sought and highly prized in the workplace.

# Strategies for Strengthening Sociability Skills

Studies have shown that people who lack sociability skills can learn them. Scientists have found that after learning about sociability, the brains of study participants showed changes in the socio-cognition hub, with gains associated with increased empathy.  

Strategies for improving sociability include the following:  

- Warmly greet the people you encounter during your day, even strangers.  
- Prior to attending a meeting or social event, think about what you may want to ask others and what you can contribute to the conversation or discussion.  
- Don't focus solely on notetaking in workplace meetings. Be present and pay attention to what people say and how they say it. Watch for nonverbal cues that convey what people are thinking or feeling, and respond appropriately.  
- Find opportunities to collaborate on projects or tasks with others, and reflect on what you learn from these interactions.  
- If you disagree with another person, do your best to remain open-minded as you listen to their point of view.

# The Effect of Social Media on Sociability

**Tip:**  
Research is mixed regarding the effect of social media on sociability. Some studies indicate that social media can increase social support, which has a positive effect. However, others show that people tend to represent only the most exciting and happiest parts of their lives. This can lead to negative self-comparison and feelings of loneliness.  

The general conclusion is that some social media use is fine, but it is essential to develop and maintain positive relationships with the people you interact with offline.

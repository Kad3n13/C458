<h1>Module 7</h1>

<p>Although 59% of Americans align their food choices with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, individuals in the United States spend $14 billion each year in obesity-related medical costs, $245 billion for type 2 diabetes, and $316 billion for heart disease, all of which may be prevented through a healthy diet. Why doesn't everyone eat healthy? It may be that 8 in 10 Americans think advice about what to eat is conflicting. It may also be due to cultural beliefs, lack of resources, or simply that many unhealthy foods taste good.</p>
<br>

  <p>In this module, you will use your knowledge of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to better understand the food choices that make up a healthy eating pattern. More specifically, you will explore the general U.S. Dietary Guidelines and key recommendations for healthy eating. You will learn about the tools available to monitor your eating patterns and teach others how to monitor theirs. After engaging in this module, you should be able to identify components of a healthy diet.</p>

<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

<h2>Identify the dietary guidelines and key recommendations for a healthy diet</h2>

<p>About 117 million individuals have one or more preventable chronic diseases. More than two-thirds of adults and nearly one-third of children and youth are overweight or obese. The good news is that these diseases can be preventable through healthy eating.</p>

<h3>In this lesson, you will learn about the dietary recommendations for a healthy diet.</h3>

<h1>General U.S Dietary Guidlines at a Glance</h1>

<p>What exactly is healthy eating? Every five years, U.S. Health and Human Services revises the U.S. Dietary Guidelines that provide recommendations for healthy eating to promote overall health and help prevent chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines consist of general guidelines and key recommendations to help prevent diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. There are five general guidelines that encourage eating healthy.</p>


<h1>Recommendation 1: Follow a Healthy Eating Pattern across the Life Span</h1>

<p>Develop a healthy eating pattern of consuming foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. An eating pattern represents the totality of all foods and beverages consumed. All foods consumed as part of a healthy eating pattern fit together like a puzzle to meet nutritional needs without exceeding limits, such as those for saturated fats, added sugars, sodium, and total calories. All forms of foods—including fresh, canned, dried, and frozen—can be included in healthy eating patterns.</p>

<h1>What dose a Healthy Eating Pattern include and Limit</h1>

> <h3>A healthy eating pattern includes the following:</h3>

> <h3> A variety of vegetables from all subgroups</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dark green vegetables</li>
  <li>Red and orange vegetables</li>
  <li>Legumes (e.g beans, and peas)</li>
  <li>Starchy vegetables (e.g corn, potatoes)</li>
  
  > <h3>Others</h3>
  
  <li>Fruits, especially whole fruits</li>
  <li>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</li>
  <li>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages</li>
  <li>A variety of profein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy prodcuts</li>
  <li>Oils (e.g Canola, Olive)</li>
  
  > <h3>A healthy eating pattern limits the following:</h3>
  
  <li>Saturated fats</li>
  <li>Trans fats</li>
  <li>Added sugars</li>
  <li>Soduim</li>
</ul>

<h1>Recommendation 2: Focus on Variety, Nutrient Density, and Amount</h1>
<p>choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods from each food group in recommended amounts. Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins, minerals, and other substances with little or no solid fats and added sugars, refined starches, or sodium.</p>

<h3>Example of nutrient-dense food choices include the following:</h3>

| **CHOOSE THIS FOOD**                       | **INSTEAD OF THIS FOOD**                      | **RATIONALE**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh fruit (80–100 calories)             | 1 cup fruit juice drink (140 calories)<br>12 ounces sweetened sugar drinks (160 calories) | Whole fruit has fiber not found in fruit juice or sweetened beverages. Unlike whole fruit, sweetened sugar drinks do not have any vitamins or minerals.         |
| Skinless grilled chicken breast (31 calories per ounce) | Chicken nuggets (85 calories per ounce)        | Chicken nuggets have more calories, saturated fat, and sodium than grilled chicken.                                                                             |
| 1 cup kale and quinoa salad (190 calories)| 1 cup Caesar salad with romaine lettuce (180 calories) | The calories of these salads are almost the same, but the kale and quinoa have more nutrient value. Kale has vitamins A, C, and K and fiber. Quinoa is a complete protein rich in fiber, iron, zinc, B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. |

<h1>Recommendation 3: Limit Sugars and Saturated Fats and Reduce Sodium Intake</h1>

<p>Consume food low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. Cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components to amounts that fit within a healthy eating pattern. 

For example, added sugars are found in sodas, soft drinks, and processed baked goods. Saturated and trans fats are found in ice cream and fast food like hamburgers. Pizza and sliced processed meats for sandwiches have high levels of sodium. </p>

<h1>Recommendation 4: Shift to Healthier Food and Beverage Choices</h1>

<p>Replace typical food and beverage choices with more nutrient-dense options. Be sure to consider personal preferences to maintain shifts over time. 

For example, instead of fettuccine alfredo — a pasta dish with refined grains and high-fat dairy—choose pasta primavera made with whole-grain pasta, vegetables, and a small amount of olive oil.</p>

<h1>Recommendation 5: Support Healthy Eating Patterns in all Situations</h1>

<p>Everyone has a role in creating and supporting healthy eating patterns in multiple settings nationwide, from home to school to work to community. As a teacher, you will have an important role supporting children and teaching them both how to make healthy food choices and what the impact is of nutrition on physical and emotional health.</p>
